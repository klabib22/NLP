Greek philosophers <a href=\"/wiki/Aristarchus_of_Samos\" title=\"Aristarchus of Samos\">Aristarchus of Samos</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Aristotle\" title=\"Aristotle\">Aristotle</a>, and <a href=\"/wiki/Ptolemy\" title=\"Ptolemy\">Ptolemy</a> proposed different cosmological theories.

Similarly, he made a mixture of the <i>Same,</i> and then one of the <i>Different,</i> in between their indivisible and their corporeal, divisible counterparts. And he took the three mixtures and mixed them together to make a uniform mixture, forcing the Different, which was hard to mix, into conformity with the Same. Now when he had mixed these two with Being, and from the three had made a single mixture, he redivided the whole mixture into as many parts as his task required, each part remaining a mixture of the Same, the Different and Being.\" (35a-b), translation Donald J.

      "journey, asking him to visit him when he came\n",
      "\n",
      "Audunn went on his way until he reached the city of Rome in the\n",
      "south. When he had stayed there as long as he wished, he turned\n",
      "back, and a severe illness attacked him, and he grew terribly\n",
      "emaciated. All the money which the King had given him for his\n",
      "pilgrimage was now spent, and so he took up his staff and begged his\n",
      "food. By now his hair had fallen out and he looked in a bad way. He\n",
      "got back to Denmark at Easter, and went to the place where the King\n",
      "was stationed. He dared not let the King see him, but stayed in a\n",
      "side-aisle of the church, intending to approach the King when he\n",
      "went to church for Nones. But when Audunn beheld the King and his\n",
      "courtiers splendidly arrayed, he did not dare to show himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the King went to drink in his hall, Audunn ate his meal out of\n",
      "doors, as is the custom of Rome pilgrims, so long as they have not\n",
      "laid aside their staff and scrip. In the evening, when the King went\n",
      "to Vespers, Audunn intended to meet him, but shy as he was before,\n",
      "he was much more so now that the courtiers were merry with drink. As\n",
      "they were going back, the King noticed a man, and thought he could\n",
      "see that he had not the confidence to come forward and meet him. But\n",
      "as the courtiers walked in, the King turned back and said:\n",
      "\n",
      "Let the man who wants to meet me come forward; I think there must be\n",
      "someone who does.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Audunn came forward and fell at the feet of the King, but the\n",
      "King hardly recognized him. As soon as he knew who he was, he took\n",
      "Audunn by the hand and welcomed him:--You have changed a lot since\n",
      "we met last,--he said, and then he led Audunn into the hall after\n",
      "him. When the courtiers saw Audunn they laughed at him, but the King\n",
      "said:\n",
      "\n",
      "There is no need for you to laugh at this man, for he has provided\n",
      "better for his soul than you have.\n",
      "\n",
      "The King had a bath prepared for Audunn and then gave him clothes,\n",
      "and now he stayed with the King.\n",

      "\n",

      "It is told that one day in the spring the King invited Audunn to\n",
      "stay with him for good, and said he would make him his cup-bearer,\n",
      "and do him great honour.\n",
      "\n",
      "Audunn answered: May God reward you, my Lord, for all the favours\n",
      "you would show me, but my heart is set on sailing out to Iceland.\n",
      "\n",
      "The King said: This seems a strange choice to me,--but Audunn\n",
      "answered: My Lord, I cannot bear to think that I should be enjoying\n",
      "high honour here with you, while my mother is living the life of a\n",
      "beggar out in Iceland. For by now, all that I contributed for her\n",
      "subsistence before I left Iceland, has been used up.\n",
      "\n",
      "The King answered: That is well spoken and like a man, and good\n",
      "fortune will go with you. This was the one reason for your departure\n",
      "which would not have offended me. So stay with me until the ships\n",
      "are made ready for sea.--And this Audunn did.\n",
      "\n",
      "One day towards the end of spring King Sveinn walked down to the\n",
      "quay, where men were getting ships ready to sail to various lands,\n",
      "to the Baltic lands and Germany, to Sweden and Norway. The King and\n",
      "Audunn came to a fine vessel, and there were some men busy fitting\n",
      "her out. The King asked:\n",
      "\n",
      "How do you like this ship, Audunn?\n",
      "\n",
      "Audunn answered: I like her well, my Lord.\n",
      "\n",
      "The King said: I will give you this ship and reward you for the\n",
      "white bear.\n",
      "\n",
      "Audunn thanked the King for his gift as well as he knew how.\n",
      "\n",
      "After a time, when the ship was quite ready to sail, King Sveinn\n",
      "said to Audunn:\n",
      "\n",
      "If you wish to go now, I shall not hinder you, but I have heard that\n",
      "you are badly off for harbours in your country, and that there are\n",
      "many shelterless coasts, dangerous to shipping. Now, supposing you\n",
      "are wrecked, and lose your ship and your goods, there will be little\n",
      "to show that you have visited King Sveinn and brought him a precious\n",
      "gift.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the King handed him a leather purse full of silver: You will\n",
      "not be altogether penniless, said he, even if you wreck your ship,\n",
      "so long as you can hold on to this. But yet it may be, said the\n",
      "King, that you will lose this money, and then it will be of little\n",
      "use to you that you have been to see King Sveinn and given him a\n",
      "precious gift.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the King drew a ring from his arm and gave it to Audunn,\n",
      "saying: Even if it turns out so badly that you wreck your ship and\n",
      "lose your money, you will still not be a pauper if you reach land,\n",
      "for many men have gold about them in a shipwreck, and if you keep\n",
      "this ring there will be something to show that you have been to see\n",
      "King Sveinn. But I will give you this advice, said the King, do not\n",
      "give this ring away, unless you should feel yourself so much\n",
      "indebted to some distinguished man--then give the ring to him, for\n",
      "it is a fitting gift for a man of rank. And now farewell.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "After this Audunn put to sea and made Norway, and had his\n",
      "merchandise brought ashore, and that was a more laborious task than\n",
      "it had been last time he was in Norway. Then he went into the\n",
      "presence of King Haraldr, wishing to fulfil the promise he had given\n",
      "him before he went to Denmark. Audunn gave the King a friendly\n",
      "greeting, which he accepted warmly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sit down, said the King, and drink with us, and so Audunn did. Then\n",
      "King Haraldr asked: What reward did King Sveinn give you for the\n",
      "bear?\n",
      "\n",
      "Audunn answered: This, my Lord, that he accepted him from me.\n",
      "\n",
      "I would have given you that, said the King, but what else did he\n",
      "give you?\n",
      "\n",
      "Audunn said: He gave me silver to make a pilgrimage to Rome, but\n",
      "King Haraldr said:\n",
      "\n",
      "King Sveinn gives many people silver for pilgrimages and for other\n",
      "things, even if they do not bring him valuable gifts. What more did\n",
      "he do for you?\n",
      "\n",
      "He offered to make me his cup-bearer and to give me great honours.\n",
      "\n",
      "That was a good offer, said the King, but he must have given you\n",
      "still more.\n",
      "\n",
      "Audunn said: He gave me a merchantman with a cargo of wares most\n",
      "profitable for the Norway trade.\n",
      "\n",
      "That was generous, said the King, but I would have rewarded you as\n",
      "well as that. Did he give you anything else?\n",
      "\n",
      "Audunn said: He gave me a leather purse full of silver, and said\n",
      "that I would still not be penniless if I kept it, even if my ship\n",
      "were wrecked off Iceland.\n",
      "\n",
      "The King said: That was magnificent, and more than I should have\n",
      "done. I would have thought my debt discharged if I had given you the\n",
      "ship. Did he give you anything else?\n",
      "\n",
      "Certainly he gave me something else, my Lord, said Audunn; he gave\n",
      "me this ring which I am wearing on my arm, and said that I might\n",
      "chance to lose all my property, and yet not be destitute if I had\n",
      "this ring. But he advised me not to part with it unless I were under\n",
      "such an obligation to some noble man that I wished to give it to\n",
      "him. And now I have come to the right man, for it was in your power\n",
      "to take from me both my bear and my life, but you allowed me to go\n",
      "to Denmark in peace when others could not go there.\n",
      "\n",
      "The King received the gift graciously and gave Audunn fine presents\n",
      "in exchange before they parted. Audunn laid out his merchandise on\n",
      "his voyage to Iceland, and sailed out that same summer, and people\n",
      "thought him the luckiest of men.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "It had rained for a fortnight--not all the time heavily, but a fog\n",
      "had sullenly hung about the mountain tops, clinging to the\n",
      "atmosphere and rendering the whole of existence a dull gray colour.\n",
      "Every little while it would discharge a fine drizzle of rain or a\n",
      "heavy shower down upon the hay and everything else on earth, so that\n",
      "only the stones would occasionally be dry--but the grass never.\n",
      "\n",
      "We were tired of the store--indeed, I should like to know who would\n",
      "have enjoyed it. It dated back to the beginning of the last century,\n",
      "a tarred, coal-black, ramshackle hut. The windows were low and\n",
      "small, the windowpanes diminutive. The ceiling was low. Everything\n",
      "was arranged in such a way as to exclude the possibility of lofty\n",
      "flights of thought or vision.\n",
      "\n",
      "Just now, not a living soul looked in--not even those thriftless\n",
      "fellows who lived by chance jobs in the village and met in daily\n",
      "conclave at the store. We had often cursed their lengthy visits, but\n",
      "now that they had hired themselves out during the haymaking, we\n",
      "suddenly realized that they had often been entertaining. They had\n",
      "made many amusing remarks and brought us news of the neighbourhood.\n",
      "And now we cursed them for their absence.\n",
      "\n",
      "We sat there and smoked, staring vacantly at the half-empty shelves,\n",
      "and all but shivering in the damp room. There was no heater in the\n",
      "store at any season, and the one in the office, if used, emitted\n",
      "spurts of smoke through every aperture except the chimney. It had\n",
      "not been cleaned since sometime during winter, and we were not\n",
      "ambitious enough for such an undertaking in the middle of the\n",
      "summer.\n",
      "\n",
      "We tried to transfer our thoughts from the store to the world\n",
      "outside. We made clever comments to the effect that the farmers were\n",
      "now getting plenty of moisture for the hay-fields, and that it would\n",
      "be a pity if rain should set in now, right at the beginning of the\n",
      "haying season. We had nothing further to say on the subject, but\n",
      "this we repeated from day to day. In short, we were depressed and at\n",
      "odds with things in general. Until the dry spell.\n",
      "\n",
      "One morning, about nine o'clock, the bank of fog began to move.\n",
      "First, there appeared an opening about the size of your hand, and\n",
      "through it the eastern sky showed a bright blue. Then another\n",
      "opening, and through it shone the sun.\n",
      "\n",
      "We knew what this was called, and we said to each other: Merely a\n",
      "'morning promise'--implying, nothing reliable. But it was more. The\n",
      "fog began to show thinner and move faster along the mountain ridge\n",
      "opposite. Then it gathered in a deep pass and lay there heaped up\n",
      "like newly carded, snowy wool. On either side, the mountains loomed\n",
      "a lovely blue, and in their triumph ignored the fog almost\n",
      "completely. When we ventured a look through the doorway of the\n",
      "store, there was nothing to be seen overhead save the clear, blue\n",
      "sky and the sunshine.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the opposite shore of the fjord, the people looked to us like the\n",
      "cairns out on the moorlands, only these tiny cairns moved in single\n",
      "file about the hay-fields. I seemed to smell the sweet hay in the\n",
      "homefields, but of course this was only my imagination. I also\n",
      "fancied I could hear the maids laughing, especially one of them. I\n",
      "would willingly have sacrificed a good deal to be over there helping\n",
      "her dry the hay. But of this subject no more; I did not intend to\n",
      "write a love story--at least, not in the ordinary sense of the word.\n",
      "\n",
      "The dry spell lasted. We, the clerks, took turns at staying out of\n",
      "doors as much as possible, and 'drinking deeply of the golden fount\n",
      "of sunshine'.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the afternoon of the third day, I dropped in at the doctor's. I\n",
      "felt somewhat weary with walking--and idleness--and looked forward\n",
      "to the doctor's couch and conversation.\n",
      "\n",
      "A cigar? asked the doctor.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, a cigar, I answered. I have smoked only six today.\n",
      "\n",
      "Beer or whisky and water? queried the doctor.\n",
      "\n",
      "A small whisky, I replied.\n",
      "\n",
      "I lit my cigar, inhaling deeply of its fragrance--then exhaling\n",
      "through mouth and nostrils. I sighed with contentment; the cigar was\n",
      "excellent.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then we began to drink the whisky and water at our leisure. I\n",
      "reclined against the head of the couch, stretched out my feet, was\n",
      "conscious of a luxurious sensation--and sent my thoughts for a\n",
      "moment across the fjord, where they preferred to remain.\n",
      "\n",
      "The doctor was in high spirits. He talked about the Japanese and\n",
      "Russians, the most recently discovered rays, and the latest\n",
      "disclosures on how is felt to die.\n",
      "\n",
      "My favourite pastime is to listen to others speaking. I never seem\n",
      "able to think of any topics worthy of conversation myself, but I am\n",
      "almost inclined to say that my ability to listen amounts to an art.\n",
      "I can remain silent with an air of absorbing interest, and once in a\n",
      "while offer brief comment, not to set forth an opinion or display\n",
      "any knowledge--for I have none to spare--but merely to suggest new\n",
      "channels to the speaker and introduce variety, that he may not tire\n",
      "of hearing himself speak.\n",
      "\n",
      "I felt extremely comfortable on the couch. I thought it particularly\n",
      "entertaining to hear the doctor tell how it felt to die. There is\n",
      "always something pleasantly exciting about death--when it is\n",
      "reasonably far away from you. It seemed so beautifully far away from\n",
      "the perfume of the tobacco-smoke, the flavour of whisky, and the\n",
      "restfulness of the couch, and when my mind wandered to her across\n",
      "the fjord--as wander it would in spite of my studied attention--then\n",
      "death seemed so far off shore that I could scarcely follow the\n",
      "description of how it felt to others to die.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the midst of this dreamy contentment and deluge of information\n",
      "from the doctor, the door was somewhat hastily thrown open. I was\n",
      "looking the other way and thought it must be one of the doctor's\n",
      "children.\n",
      "\n",
      "But it was old man Thordur from the Bend.\n",
      "\n",
      "I knew him well. He was over fifty, tall and large-limbed, with a\n",
      "hoary shock of hair and a snub nose. I knew he had a host of\n",
      "children--I had been at his door once, and they had run, pattered,\n",
      "waddled, crept, and rolled through the doorway to gape at me. It had\n",
      "seemed as hopeless to try to count them as a large flock of sheep. I\n",
      "knew there was no income except what the old man and woman--and\n",
      "possibly the elder children--managed to earn from day to day. My\n",
      "employer in Copenhagen had strictly forbidden us to give credit to\n",
      "such--and of course he now owed us more than he would ever be able\n",
      "to pay.\n",
      "\n",
      "He does not even knock--the old ruffian, I said to myself.\n",
      "\n",
      "From his appearance, something was wrong. His face was unnaturally\n",
      "purplish, his eyes strangely shiny--yet dull withal. It even seemed\n",
      "to me that his legs shook under him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Can it be that the old devil is tipsy--at the height of the haying\n",
      "season--and dry weather at that? I mentally queried.\n",
      "\n",
      "The doctor evidently could not recall who he was.\n",
      "\n",
      "Good-day to you, my man, he said, and what matter have you in hand?\n",
      "\n",
      "I merely came to get those four crowns.\n",
      "\n",
      "Which four crowns? asked the doctor.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thordur raised his voice: The four crowns you owe me.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was now evident that it was difficult for him to remain standing.\n",
      "\n",
      "I felt assured that the old rascal had been drinking like a fish. I\n",
      "was surprised. I had never heard he was inclined that way. He lived\n",
      "out there on the hillside a short distance above the village. I\n",
      "began to wonder where he had been able to obtain so much liquor--\n",
      "certainly not from us at the store.\n",
      "\n",
      "What is your name? asked the doctor.\n",
      "\n",
      "My name? Don't you know my name? Don't you know me?--Thordur--\n",
      "Thordur of the Bend. I should best of all like to get the money at\n",
      "once.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, that's so--you are Thordur of the Bend, said the doctor. And\n",
      "you are up? But listen, my good man, I owe you nothing. You owe me a\n",
      "small sum--but that does not matter in the least.\n",
      "\n",
      "I care nothing about that, but I should best of all like to get the\n",
      "money at once, repeated Thordur.\n",
      "\n",
      "May I feel your hand for a minute? said the doctor.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thordur extended his hand, but it seemed to me that he did not know\n",
      "it. He looked off into space, as if thinking of other things--or\n",
      "rather as if he had no thoughts whatever. I saw the doctor's fingers\n",
      "on his wrist.\n",
      "\n",
      "You are a sick man, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sick?--Yes--of course I am sick. Am I then to pay you four crowns? I\n",
      "haven't got them now.\n",
      "\n",
      "It makes no difference about those four crowns, but why did you get\n",
      "up like this? Have you forgotten that I ordered you to remain in bed\n",
      "when I saw you the other day?\n",
      "\n",
      "In bed?--How the devil am I to remain in bed? Tell me that!\n",
      "\n",
      "You must not get up in this condition. Why, you are delirious!\n",
      "\n",
      "What a fool you are--don't you know that there is a dry spell.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, I AM aware of the dry spell.--It was evidently not quite clear\n",
      "to him what that had to do with the case.--Have a chair, and we will\n",
      "talk it over.\n",
      "\n",
      "A chair? No!--Who, then, should dry the hay in the homefield? I had\n",
      "some of it cut when I was taken down--why do you contradict me? And\n",
      "the youngsters have made some attempts at it--but who is to see\n",
      "about drying it?--Not Gudrun--she can't do everything. The\n",
      "youngsters?--what do they know about drying hay?--Who, then, is to\n",
      "do it?--Are YOU going to do it?\n",
      "\n",
      "Something will turn up for you, said the doctor, somewhat at a loss.\n",
      "\n",
      "Something will turn up? Nothing has ever turned up for ME.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cold shivers passed through me. His remark rang true: I knew that\n",
      "nothing had ever turned up for him. I felt faint at looking into\n",
      "such an abyss of hopelessness. Instantly I saw that the truth of\n",
      "this delirious statement concerned me more than all the wisdom of\n",
      "the ages.\n",
      "\n",
      "Do I get those four crowns you owe me?--Thordur asked. He was now\n",
      "trembling so that his teeth chattered.\n",
      "\n",
      "The doctor produced four crowns from his purse and handed them to\n",
      "him. Thordur laid them on the table and staggered towards the door.-\n",
      "-You are leaving your crowns behind, man, said the doctor.\n",
      "\n",

      "THE OLD HAY\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "During the latter part of the reign of King Christian the Ninth,\n",
      "there lived at Holl in the Tunga District a farmer named Brandur. By\n",
      "the time the events narrated here transpired, Brandur had grown\n",
      "prosperous and very old--old in years and old in ways. The\n",
      "neighbours thought he must have money hidden away somewhere. But no\n",
      "one knew anything definitely, for Brandur had always been reserved\n",
      "and uncommunicative, and permitted no prying in his house or on his\n",
      "possessions. There was, however, one thing every settler in those\n",
      "parts knew: Brandur had accumulated large stores of various kinds.\n",
      "Anyone passing along the highway could see that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Brandur usually had some hay remaining in lofts and yards when\n",
      "spring came, and, besides, there was the immense stack that stood on\n",
      "a knoll out in the homefield before the house. It had been there for\n",
      "many years and was well protected against wind and weather by a\n",
      "covering of sod. Brandur had replenished the hay, a little at a\n",
      "time, by using up that from one end only and filling in with fresh\n",
      "hay the following summer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Brandur was hospitable to such guests as had business with him, and\n",
      "refused to accept payment for food or lodging; but very few people\n",
      "ever came to see him, and these were mostly old friends with whom he\n",
      "had financial dealings. Brandur was willing to make loans against\n",
      "promissory notes and the payment of interest. There were not many to\n",
      "whom he would entrust his money, however, and he never lost a penny.\n",
      "Whenever these callers came, he would bring out the brandy bottle.\n",
      "\n",
      "The buildings at Holl were all in a tumble-down state; the furniture\n",
      "was no better. There wasn't a chair in the whole house; even the\n",
      "baðstofa had only a dirt floor, and it was entirely unsheathed on\n",
      "the inside except for a few planks nailed on the wall from the bed\n",
      "up as far as the rafters. The clock was the sole manufactured\n",
      "article in the room. But friends of the old man knew that underneath\n",
      "his bed he kept a fairly large carved wooden chest, bearing the\n",
      "inscription anno 1670. The chest was heavy and was always kept\n",
      "locked. Only the nearest of kin had ever seen its contents.\n",
      "\n",
      "Brandur was not considered obliging; it was very difficult to get to\n",
      "see him. Yet he was willing to sell food at any time for cash; hay,\n",
      "too, as long as there was still some remaining in his lofts. He\n",
      "would also sell hay against promises of lambs, especially wethers,\n",
      "once it was certain that the cold of winter was past. But his old\n",
      "haystack he refused to touch for anyone.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this way Brandur stumbled down the pathway of life until he lost\n",
      "his sight. Even then, he was still sound in mind and body. While his\n",
      "vision remained unimpaired, it had been his habit to walk out to the\n",
      "old haystack every day and stroll around it slowly, examining it\n",
      "carefully from top to bottom and patting it with his hands. This\n",
      "habit he kept up as long as the weather permitted him to be\n",
      "outdoors, and he did not give it up even after his sight was gone.\n",
      "He would still take his daily walk out to the haystack on the knoll,\n",
      "drag himself slowly around it, groping with his hands to feel it, as\n",
      "if he wished to make sure that it still stood there, firm as a rock\n",
      "and untouched. He would stretch out his hands and touch its face and\n",
      "count the strips of turf to himself in a whisper.\n",
      "\n",
      "Brandur still tilled the land, though he kept but little help and\n",
      "was living chiefly on the fruits of his former labours. He had fine\n",
      "winter pastures, and good meadows quite near the house, from which\n",
      "the hay could easily be brought in. The old man steadfastly refused\n",
      "to adopt modern farming methods; he had never levelled off the\n",
      "hummocks, nor drained or irrigated the land. But he did hire a few\n",
      "harvest hands in the middle of the season, paying them in butter,\n",
      "tallow, and the flesh of sheep bellies. The wages he paid were never\n",
      "high, yet he always paid whatever had been agreed upon.\n",
      "\n",
      "Old Brandur had been blessed with only one child, a daughter named\n",
      "Gudrun. who had married a farmer in the district. Since his\n",
      "daughter's marriage, Brandur kept a housekeeper and one farm hand, a\n",
      "young man whom Brandur had reared and who, it was rumoured, was his\n",
      "natural son. But that has nothing to do with the story.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Brandur had reached a ripe old age, there came a winter with\n",
      "much frost and snow. Time and again, some of the snow and ice would\n",
      "thaw, but then a hard frost would come, glazing everything in an icy\n",
      "coating. This went on until late in April. By that time, almost\n",
      "every farmer in the district had used up his hay; every one of them\n",
      "was at the end of his store, and nowhere was there a blade of grass\n",
      "to feed the live-stock, for the land still lay frozen under its\n",
      "blanket of hard-packed snow and ice. When things had come to this\n",
      "pass, a general district meeting was called to discuss the situation\n",
      "and decide what should be done. Brandur's son-in-law Jon was made\n",
      "chairman of the meeting.\n",
      "\n",
      "During the discussion it was brought to light that many of the\n",
      "flocks would die of hunger unless 'God Almighty vouchsafed a turn in\n",
      "the weather very soon', or Old Brandur could be induced to part with\n",
      "his old hay. That stack would help, if properly divided among those\n",
      "who were in greatest need. The quantity of hay it contained was\n",
      "estimated, and the general opinion expressed that, if it were\n",
      "divided, the flocks of every farmer in the district could be fed for\n",
      "at least two weeks, even if they could not in that time be put out\n",
      "to pasture.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jon being chairman of the District Council, as well as Brandur's\n",
      "son-in-law, it fell to his lot to go to the old man and ask for the\n",
      "hay.\n",
      "\n",
      "So it came about that, on his way home from the meeting, Jon stopped\n",
      "at Holl. The day was cold and clear, the afternoon sun shining down\n",
      "upon the snow-covered landscape. The icy blanket turned back the\n",
      "rays of warmth as if it would have nothing to do with the sun. But\n",
      "wherever rocks and gravelly banks protruded, the ice appeared to be\n",
      "peeled off, for in those spots the sun's rays had melted it, though\n",
      "only at mid-day and on the south. All streams and waterfalls\n",
      "slumbered in silence under the snowy blanket. A chill silence\n",
      "reigned over the whole valley. Not a bird was to be seen, not even a\n",
      "snow bunting, only two ravens which kept flying from farmhouse to\n",
      "farmhouse, and even their cawing had a hungry note.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Jon rode up to the house at Holl, he found Brandur out by the\n",
      "haystack. The old man was carefully groping his way around the\n",
      "stack, feeling it on all sides and counting the strips of turf in so\n",
      "loud a voice that Jon could hear him: O-n-e, t-w-o, three.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jon dismounted and, going over to Brandur, saluted him with a kiss.\n",
      "\n",
      "How are you? God bless you, said Brandur. And who may this be?\n",
      "\n",
      "Jon of Bakki, replied the visitor.--Gudrun sends greetings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ah, yes. And how is my Gunna? Is she well?\n",
      "\n",
      "She was well when I left home this morning. Now I am on my way back\n",
      "from the meeting that was held to discuss the desperate situation--\n",
      "you must have heard about it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, certainly. I've heard about it. I should say so! One can't get\n",
      "away from talk of hay shortage and hard times. That is quite true.\n",
      "Any other news?\n",
      "\n",
      "Nothing worth mentioning, answered Jon. Nothing but the general hard\n",
      "times and hay shortage. Every farmer at the end of his tether, or\n",
      "almost there, no one with as much as a wisp of hay to spare, and\n",
      "only a few likely to make out till Crouchmas without aid.\n",
      "\n",
      "Too bad! said Brandur. Too bad! And he blew out his breath, as\n",
      "though suffocating from strong smoke or bad air.\n",
      "\n",
      "For a while there was silence, as if each mistrusted the other and\n",
      "wondered what was in the air. Brandur stood there with one hand\n",
      "resting on the haystack, while he thrust the other into his trousers\n",
      "pocket, or underneath the flap of his trousers. He always wore the\n",
      "old-fashioned trousers with a flap, in fact had never possessed any\n",
      "other kind. Meanwhile, holding the reins, Jon stood there gazing at\n",
      "the hay and making a mental estimate of it. Then he turned to his\n",
      "father-in-law and spoke:\n",
      "\n",
      "The purpose of my visit to you, my dear Brandur, is to ask that you\n",
      "let us have this hay--this fine old hay that you have here. The\n",
      "District Council will, of course, pay you; the parish will guarantee\n",
      "payment. We have discussed that matter fully.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Jon ceased speaking, Brandur blew the air from his mouth in\n",
      "great puffs, as though deeply stabbed by a sharp pain in the heart.\n",
      "For a while he held his peace. Then he spoke:\n",
      "\n",
      "Not another word! Not another word! What's this I hear? My hay for\n",
      "the district? My hay to supply all the farmers in the district? Do\n",
      "you think for one moment that this little haystack is enough to feed\n",
      "all the flocks in the whole district? Do you think this tiny haycock\n",
      "will be enough for a whole parish? I think not!\n",
      "\n",
      "But we have calculated it, protested Jon. We have estimated that the\n",
      "hay in this stack will be enough to feed the flocks in the district\n",
      "for about two weeks, if a little grain is used with it, and if the\n",
      "hay is distributed equally among the farmers who need it most. There\n",
      "may be enough for three weeks, should it turn to be as much as or\n",
      "more than I expect. By that time, we surely hope, the season will be\n",
      "so far advanced that the weather will have changed for the better.\n",
      "\n",
      "So! You have already estimated the amount of hay in my stack! said\n",
      "Brandur. You have already divided this miserable haycock among\n",
      "yourselves, divided it down to the very last straw. And you have\n",
      "weighed it almost to a gram. Then why speak to me about it? Why not\n",
      "take it just as it is and scatter it to the four winds? Why not?--\n",
      "The voice of the old man shook with anger.\n",
      "\n",
      "No, said Jon. We will not do that. We want to ask your permission\n",
      "first. We had no intention of doing otherwise; we intended to ask\n",
      "you for the hay. And we did not mean to vex you, but rather to\n",
      "honour you in this manner. Is it not an honour to be asked to save a\n",
      "whole district from ruin?\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh, so all this is being done to honour me! said the old man,\n",
      "roaring with laughter. Perhaps you believe me to be in my second\n",
      "childhood. Not at all! Old Brandur can still see beyond the tip of\n",
      "his nose.\n",
      "\n",
      "The cold-heartedness shown by the old man's laughter at the distress\n",
      "of his fellowmen roused Jon's ire. He could see nothing laughable\n",
      "about the desperate situation in the district.\n",
      "\n",
      "Are you then going to refuse to let us have the hay, refuse to sell\n",
      "it at full price, with the Parish Council guaranteeing payment? he\n",
      "asked in a tone that was angry, yet under perfect control?--Is that\n",
      "your final answer?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, responded Brandur. That is my final answer. I will not let the\n",
      "tiny mouthful of hay I have here go while there is still life in my\n",
      "body, even though you mean to insure payment, and even though you\n",
      "actually do guarantee payment. After all, who among you will be in a\n",
      "position to guarantee payment if all the flocks die? The cold\n",
      "weather may not let up until the first of June or even later. In\n",
      "that case the sheep will all die. It won't go very far, this tiny\n",
      "haycock, not for so many. It will not, I tell you.\n",
      "\n",
      "But what are you going to do with the hay? If everyone else loses\n",
      "his flocks, everyone but you, what enjoyment will there be in owning\n",
      "it? And what benefit? asked Jon.\n",
      "\n",
      "That does not concern me! replied the old man. That concerns them.\n",
      "It was they who decided the size of the flocks they undertook to\n",
      "feed this winter, not I. Besides, they could have cut as much hay as\n",
      "I did, even more, for they still have their eyesight. Their failure\n",
      "is due to their own laziness and bad judgment. That's what ails\n",
      "them! Ruins them!\n",
      "\n",
      "But you won't be able to take this great big haystack with you into\n",
      "the life eternal, said Jon. The time is coming when you will have to\n",
      "part with it. Then it will be used as the needs require. And what\n",
      "good will it do you? What are you going to do with it?\n",
      "\n",
      "I am going to keep it, answered Brandur. I intend to keep it right\n",
      "here on the knoll, keep it in case the haying should be poor next\n",
      "summer. There may be a poor growth of grass and a small hay crop;\n",
      "there may be a volcanic eruption and the ashes may poison the grass,\n",
      "as they have done in former years. Now, do you understand me?\n",
      "\n",
      "So saying, Brandur tottered off towards the house to indicate that\n",
      "the conversation was at an end. His countenance was as cold as the\n",
      "sky in the evening after the sun has set, and the hard lines in it\n",
      "resembled the streaks in the ice on rocks and ledges where the sun's\n",
      "rays had shone that day and laid bare the frozen ground.\n",
      "\n",
      "Brandur entered the house, while Jon mounted again. They scarcely\n",
      "said a word of farewell, so angry were they both.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jon's horse set off at a brisk pace, eager to reach home, and\n",
      "galloped swiftly over the hard, frozen ground. After the sun had\n",
      "gone down, the wind rose and a searing cold settled over the valley,\n",
      "whitening Jon's moustache where his breath passed over it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jon's anger grew as he sped along. Naturally hightempered, he had\n",
      "lately had many reasons for anger since he took over his official\n",
      "duties. The people in his district were like people the world over:\n",
      "they blamed the Board constantly, accusing it of stupidity and\n",
      "favouritism. Yet most of them paid their taxes reluctantly and only\n",
      "when long overdue. Sometimes they were almost a year in arrears.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jon reviewed the matter of the hay in his mind, also the other\n",
      "vexations of the past. He was sick and tired of all the trouble. And\n",
      "now the life of the whole district hung on a thin thread, the fate\n",
      "of which depended upon the whims of the weather. Jon's nose and\n",
      "cheekbones smarted from the cold; his shoes were frozen stiff, and\n",
      "pinched his feet, and his throat burned with the heat of anger\n",
      "rising from his breast.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jon was rather quiet when he reached home that evening, although he\n",
      "did tell his wife of his attempt to deal with her father.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, said Gudrun, papa sets great store by that hay. He cannot bear\n",
      "to part with it at any price. That is his nature.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tomorrow you must go, Jon told her, and try to win the old man over\n",
      "in some way. I'd hate to be obliged to take the hay from him by\n",
      "force, but that will be necessary if everything else fails.\n",
      "\n",
      "The following day Gudrun went to see her father. The weather still\n",
      "remained cold. When Gudrun dismounted before the house at Holl,\n",
      "there was no one outside to greet her or announce her arrival, and\n",
      "so she entered, going straight into the baðstofa. There she found\n",
      "her father sitting on his bed, knitting a seaman's mitten, crooning\n",
      "an old ditty the while:\n",
      "\n",
      "     Far from out the wilderness\n",
      "      Comes raging the cold wind;\n",
      "      And the bonds of heaven's king\n",
      "      It doth still tighter bind.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gudrun leaned over her father and kissed him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Is that you, Gunna dear? he asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes papa, she said, at the same time slipping a flask of brandy into\n",
      "the bosom of his shirt.\n",
      "\n",
      "This greatly pleased the old man.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gunna dear, he said, you always bring me something to cheer me up.\n",
      "Not many nowadays take the trouble to cheer the old man. No indeed.\n",
      "Any news? It's so long since you have been to see me, a year or\n",
      "more.\n",
      "\n",
      "No news everyone hasn't heard: hard times, shortage of hay, and\n",
      "worry everywhere. That is only to be expected. It's been a hard\n",
      "winter, the stock stall-fed for so long, at least sixteen weeks, on\n",
      "some farms twenty.\n",
      "\n",
      "Quite true, said Brandur. It's been a cold winter, and the end is\n",
      "not yet. The cold weather may not break up before the first of June,\n",
      "or even Midsummer Day. The summer will be cold, the hay crop small,\n",
      "and the cold weather will probably set in again by the end of\n",
      "August, then another cold hard winter, and ...\n",
      "\n",
      "He meant to go on, foretelling yet worse things to come, but Gudrun\n",
      "broke in: Enough of that, father. Things can't be as bad as that It\n",
      "would be altogether too much. I hope for a change for the better\n",
      "with the new moon next week, and mark you, the new moon rises in the\n",
      "southwest and on a Monday; if I remember right, you always thought a\n",
      "new moon coming on a Monday brought good weather.\n",
      "\n",
      "I did, conceded Brandur. When I was a young man, a new moon coming\n",
      "on a Monday was generally the very best kind of moon. But like\n",
      "everything else, that has changed with the times. Now a Monday new\n",
      "moon is the worst of all, no matter in what quarter of the heavens\n",
      "it appears, if the weather is like this--raging sad carrying on so;\n",
      "that is true.\n",
      "\n",
      "But things are in a pitiful state, said Gudrun, what with the hay\n",
      "shortage, almost everyone is badly off, and not a single farmer with\n",
      "a scrap of hay to spare, except you, papa.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, I! answered Brandur. I, a poor, blind, decrepit old man! But\n",
      "what of you? Jon has enough hay, hasn't he? How is that? Doesn't he\n",
      "have enough?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, we do have enough for ourselves, admitted Gudrun. But we can't\n",
      "hold onto it. Jon lends it to those in need until it is all gone and\n",
      "there is none left for us. He thinks of others as well as of\n",
      "himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "What nonsense! What sense is there in acting like that? Every man\n",
      "for himself, said the old man.\n",
      "\n",
      "That's right. But for us that is not enough. Jon is in a position\n",
      "where he must think of others; he has to think of all the farmers in\n",
      "the district--and small thanks he gets for his pains. He is so\n",
      "upset, almost always on tenterhooks. He didn't sleep a wink last\n",
      "night--was almost beside himself. He takes it so hard.\n",
      "\n",
      "So Jon couldn't sleep a wink last night! repeated Brandur. Why be so\n",
      "upset? Why lie awake nights worrying about this? That doesn't help\n",
      "matters any. It isn't his fault that they are all on the brink of\n",
      "ruin.\n",

      "Quite true, answered Gudrun. He is not to blame for that, and lying\n",
      "awake nights doesn't help matters, but that is Jon's disposition.\n",
      "He's tired to death of all the work for the Council and the\n",
      "everlasting fault-finding. He has had to neglect his own farm since\n",
      "he took up these public duties--and nothing for his time and\n",
      "trouble. Now this is too much. He is dead tired of it all, and so am\n",
      "I. In fact, I know it was worry about all this that kept Jon awake\n",
      "last night. We have been thinking of getting away from it all when\n",
      "spring comes and going to America.\n",
      "\n",
      "Do you side with him in this? asked Brandur, grasping his daughter\n",
      "by the arm. Do you, too, agree to his giving away the hay you need\n",
      "for your own flocks, giving it away until you haven't enough for\n",
      "yourselves? Do you, too, want to go to America, away from your\n",
      "father who now has one foot in the grave?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, I do, Gudrun replied. As a matter of fact, the plan was\n",
      "originally mine. If our flocks die, there will be no alternative;\n",
      "but if our sheep live and those of the neighbours die, our life will\n",
      "not be worth living because of the poverty and want round about us.\n",
      "Yes, papa, it was I suggested our going. I could see no other way\n",
      "out.\n",
      "\n",
      "On hearing this, Brandur's mood softened somewhat. I expected to be\n",
      "allowed to pass my last days with you and your children, he said. I\n",
      "cannot go on living in this fashion any longer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pass your last days with us! exclaimed Gudrun. Have you, then,\n",
      "thought of leaving Holl? Have you planned to come and live with us?\n",
      "You've never said a word of this to me.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have no intention of leaving Holl. That I have never meant to do.\n",
      "But that is not necessary. I thought you might perhaps be willing to\n",
      "move over here and live with me. I could then let you have what\n",
      "miserable little property I have left, Gunna, my dear.\n",
      "\n",
      "And what about the hay, papa? Will you turn the hay over to us, the\n",
      "hay in the old stack? Everything depends on that.\n",
      "\n",
      "The hay! The hay! the old man said. Still harping on the hay--the\n",
      "hay which doesn't amount to anything and cannot be of any real help.\n",
      "It's sheer nonsense to think that the hay in that stack is enough to\n",
      "feed the flocks of a whole district. There is no use talking about\n",
      "it I will not throw that tiny mouthful to all the four winds. It\n",
      "will do no good if divided among so many, but it is a comfort to me,\n",
      "to me alone. No, I will not part with it as long as there is a spark\n",
      "of life in me. That I will not, my love.\n",
      "\n",
      "Brandur turned pale and the lines in his face became hard and rigid.\n",
      "Looking at him, Gudrun knew from experience that he was not to be\n",
      "shaken in his determination when in this mood. His face was like a\n",
      "sky over the wilderness streaked with threatening storm clouds.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gudrun gave up. The tears rushed to her eyes, as she twined her arms\n",
      "around her father's neck and said: Goodbye, papa. Forgive me if I\n",
      "have angered you. I shall not come here again.\n",
      "\n",
      "The old man felt the teardrops on his face, the heavy woman's tears,\n",
      "hot with anger and sorrow.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gudrun dashed out of the room and mounted. Brandur was left alone in\n",
      "the darkness at mid-day. Yet in his mind's eye he could see the\n",
      "haystack out on the knoll. He rose and went out to feel it. It was\n",
      "still there. Gudrun had not ridden away with it. Brandur could hear\n",
      "the horseshoes crunching the hard, frozen ground as Gudrun rode off.\n",
      "He stood motionless for a long time, listening to the hoof beats.\n",
      "Then he went into the house.\n",
      "\n",
      "Brandur felt restless. He paced the floor awhile, stopped for a\n",
      "moment to raise to his lips the flask his daughter had brought him,\n",
      "and drained it at one gulp. All that day he walked the floor,\n",
      "fighting with himself until night fell.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he sent his foster-son with a message to his daughter. Jon, he\n",
      "said, had his permission to haul the hay away the very next day, but\n",
      "it was all to be removed in one day; there was not to be a scrap of\n",
      "hay or a lump of sod left by evening.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the weather changes quickly, says an old Icelandic adage. By\n",
      "morning, the weather had turned its spindle and the wind shifted to\n",
      "the south. Jon sent no message to anyone, nor did he proclaim that\n",
      "the old hay was available. He first wished to see what the thaw\n",
      "would amount to. By the following day, the whole valley was\n",
      "impassable because of slush and water, and the patches of earth\n",
      "appearing through the snowy blanket grew larger almost hourly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, Brandur roamed through the house all day long, asking if\n",
      "anyone had come.--Aren't they going to take away these miserable hay\n",
      "scraps? About time they came and got them!--He seemed eager that the\n",
      "hay be removed at once.\n",
      "\n",
      "That day he did not take his usual walk out to the stack to feel the\n",
      "hay. In fact, after that no one ever saw him show attachment to the\n",
      "old hay. His love of it seemed to have died the moment he granted\n",
      "his son-in-law permission to take it away.\n",
      "\n",
      "That spring Brandur gave up housekeeping and of his own volition\n",
      "turned over the farm to his daughter and son-in-law. With them he\n",
      "lived to enjoy many years of good health. Never again did he take\n",
      "his daily walk out to the haystack to feel the hay. But he was able\n",
      "to take his sip of brandy to his dying day and repeat to himself the\n",
      "word of God--hymns and verses from the Bible.\n",

      "stranger, at a loss what to do.\n",
      "\n",
      "My idea was to continue my journey overland, and my route lay for\n",
      "the most part through the mountainous country on the other side of\n",
      "the fjord. I hadn't managed to hire horses or a guide, and it was no\n",
      "easy matter to find one's own way in such stormy weather when the\n",
      "rivers were running in full flood. This was in the spring-time,\n",
      "round about the beginning of May.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was staying at the home of the local doctor, who had given me\n",
      "shelter and who was now trying to help me in every way he could. He\n",
      "was in my room with me, and we were both sitting there, smoking\n",
      "cigars and chatting together. I had given up all hope of continuing\n",
      "my journey that day and was making myself comfortable on the\n",
      "doctor's sofa. But when we least expected it, we heard the sound of\n",
      "heavy sea-boots clumping along the corridor, and there was a knock\n",
      "at the door.\n",
      "\n",
      "Come in, said the doctor. The door opened slowly, and a young man in\n",
      "seamen's clothes stood in the doorway.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was asked to tell you that old Hrolfur from Weir will take that\n",
      "chap over there across in his boat, if he likes, said the man,\n",
      "addressing himself to the doctor.\n",
      "\n",
      "We both stood up, the doctor and I, and walked towards the door.\n",
      "That possibility hadn't occurred to either of us.\n",
      "\n",
      "Is old Hrolfur going fishing then? asked the doctor.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, he's going out to the islands and staying there about a week.\n",
      "It won't make any difference to him to slip ashore at Muladalir, if\n",
      "it would be any help.\n",
      "\n",
      "That's fine, said the doctor, turning to me. It's worth thinking\n",
      "over, unless you really need to go round the end of the fjord. It'll\n",
      "save you at least a day on your journey, and it'll be easier to get\n",
      "horses and a man in Muladalir than it is here.\n",
      "\n",
      "This was all so unexpected that I didn't quite know what to say. I\n",
      "looked at the doctor and the stranger in turn, and my first thought\n",
      "was that the doctor was trying to get rid of me. Then it occurred to\n",
      "me what a fine thing it would be to avoid having to cross all those\n",
      "rivers which flow into the head of the fjord. Finally I decided that\n",
      "the doctor had no ulterior motive and that his advice was prompted\n",
      "by sheer goodwill.\n",
      "\n",
      "Is old Hrolfur all right at the moment? the doctor asked the man in\n",
      "the doorway.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, of course he is, said the man.\n",
      "\n",
      "All right? I said, looking at them questioningly. I thought that was\n",
      "a funny thing to ask.\n",
      "\n",
      "The doctor smiled.\n",
      "\n",
      "He's just a bit queer--up here, he said, pointing to his forehead.\n",
      "\n",
      "The thought of having to set out on a long sea journey with a man\n",
      "who was half crazy made me shudder. I am certain, too, that the\n",
      "doctor could see what I was thinking, for he smiled good-naturedly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Is it safe to go with him then? I asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh yes, quite safe. He's not mad, far from it. He's just a bit\n",
      "queer--he's got 'bats in the belfry', as men say. He gets these\n",
      "attacks when he's at home in the dark winter days and has nothing to\n",
      "occupy him. But there's little sign of it in the summer. And he's a\n",
      "first-class seaman.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, a first-class seaman who never fails, said the man in the\n",
      "doorway. It's quite safe to go on board with him now. You can take\n",
      "my word for that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Are you going with him? asked the doctor.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, there's a crew of three with him. There'll be four of us in the\n",
      "boat altogether.\n",
      "\n",
      "I looked at the man in the doorway--he was a young man of about\n",
      "twenty, promising and assured. I liked the look of him, very much.\n",
      "\n",
      "Secretly I began to be ashamed of not daring to cross the fjord with\n",

      "the head'.\n",
      "\n",
      "Are you going to-day? said the doctor. Don't you think it's blowing\n",
      "a bit hard?\n",
      "\n",
      "I don't think old Hrolfur'll let that bother him, said the man and\n",
      "smiled.\n",
      "\n",
      "Can you use your sails?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, I think so--there's a fair wind.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was decided that I should go with them. I went to get ready as\n",
      "quickly as possible, and my luggage, saddle and bridle, were carried\n",
      "down to the boat.\n",
      "\n",
      "The doctor walked to the jetty with us.\n",
      "\n",
      "There, in the shelter of the breakwater, was old Hrolfur's boat, its\n",
      "mast already stepped, with the sail wrapped round it. It was a four-\n",
      "oared boat, rather bigger than usual, tarred all over except for the\n",
      "top plank, which was painted light blue. In the boat were the\n",
      "various bits of equipment needed for shark-fishing, including a\n",
      "thick wooden beam to which were attached four hooks of wrought iron,\n",
      "a keg of shark-bait which stank vilely, and barrels for the shark's\n",
      "liver. There were shark knives under the thwarts and huge gaffs\n",
      "hooked under the rib-boards. The crew had put the boxes containing\n",
      "their food and provisions in the prow.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the stern could be seen the back of a man bending down. He was\n",
      "arranging stones in the well of the boat. He was dressed in overalls\n",
      "made of skin, which reached up to his armpits and which were\n",
      "fastened by pieces of thin rope crossing over his shoulders. Further\n",
      "forward there was a second man, and a third was up on the jetty.\n",
      "\n",
      "Good day to you, Hrolfur, said the doctor.\n",
      "\n",
      "Good day to you, grunted Hrolfur as he straightened himself up and\n",
      "spat a stream of yellowish-brown liquid from his mouth. Hand me that\n",
      "stone over there.\n",
      "\n",
      "These last words were addressed not to the doctor or me, but to the\n",
      "man on the jetty. Hrolfur vouchsafed me one quick, unfriendly\n",
      "glance, but apart from that scarcely seemed to notice me. The look\n",
      "in those sharp, haunting eyes went through me like a knife. Never\n",
      "before had anyone looked at me with a glance so piercing and so full\n",
      "of misgiving.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was a small man, and lively, though ageing fast. The face was\n",
      "thin, rather wrinkled, dark and weather-beaten, with light untidy\n",
      "wisps of hair round the mouth. I was immediately struck by a curious\n",
      "twitching in his features, perhaps a relic of former bouts of\n",
      "drinking. Otherwise his expression was harsh and melancholy. His\n",
      "hands were red, swollen and calloused as if by years of rowing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Don't you think it's blowing rather hard, Hrolfur? asked the doctor\n",
      "after a long silence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh, so-so, answered Hrolfur, without looking up.\n",
      "\n",
      "Again there was silence. It was as if Hrolfur had neither time nor\n",
      "inclination for gossiping, even though it was the district medical\n",
      "officer talking to him.\n",
      "\n",
      "The doctor looked at me and smiled. I was meant to understand that\n",
      "this was exactly what he had expected.\n",
      "\n",
      "After another interval the doctor said: You are going to do this\n",
      "traveller a favour then, Hrolfur?\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh, well, the boat won't mind taking him.\n",
      "\n",
      "In other words, I was to be nothing but so much ballast.\n",
      "\n",
      "Don't you think it's going to be tricky landing there in Mular\n",
      "Creek?\n",
      "\n",
      "Hrolfur straightened up, putting his hand to his back.\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh, no, damn it, he said. There's an offshore wind and the sea's not\n",
      "bad, and anyway we'll probably get there with the incoming tide.\n",
      "\n",
      "It isn't going to take you out of your way? I asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "We won't argue about that. We'll get there all the same. We often\n",
      "give ourselves a rest in the old creek when we have to row.\n",
      "\n",
      "Immediately afterwards I said good-bye to the doctor and slid down\n",
      "into the boat. The man on the jetty cast off, threw the rope down\n",
      "into the boat and jumped in after it.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the crew thrust the handle of an oar against the breakwater\n",
      "and pushed off. Then they rowed for a short spell to get into the\n",
      "wind, whilst old Hrolfur fixed the rudder.\n",
      "\n",
      "The sail filled out; the boat heeled gently over and ran in a long\n",
      "curve. The islets at the harbour mouth rushed past us. We were\n",
      "making straight for the open bay.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the horizon before us the mountainous cliffs, dark blue with a\n",
      "thick, ragged patch of mist at the top, towered steeply over the\n",
      "waves. In between, the sea stretched out, seemingly for miles.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hrolfur was at the rudder. He sat back in the stern on a crossbeam\n",
      "flush with the gunwale, his feet braced against the ribs on either\n",
      "side and in his hands the rudder lines, one on each side, close to\n",
      "his thighs.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was up with the crew near the mast. We all knew from experience\n",
      "that Icelandic boats sailed better when well-loaded forward. All\n",
      "four of us were lying down on the windward side, but to leeward the\n",
      "foam still bubbled up over the rowlocks.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you think we're not going fast enough, lads, you'd better start\n",
      "rowing--but no extra pay, said old Hrolfur, grinning.\n",
      "\n",
      "We all took his joke well, and I felt that it brought me nearer to\n",
      "the old man; up to then I'd been just a little scared of him. A joke\n",
      "is always like an outstretched hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "For a long time we hardly spoke. In front of the mast we lay in\n",
      "silence, whilst old Hrolfur was at the stern with the whole length\n",
      "of the boat between us.\n",
      "\n",
      "The crew did all they could to make me comfortable. I lay on some\n",
      "soft sacking just in front of the thwart and kept my head under the\n",
      "gunwale for protection. The spray from the sea went right over me\n",
      "and splashed down into the boat on the far side.\n",
      "\n",
      "The boy who had come for me to the doctor's settled himself down in\n",
      "the bows in front of me. His name was Eric Ericsson, and the more I\n",
      "saw of him the more I liked him.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second member of the crew sat crosswise over the thwart with his\n",
      "back to the mast. He too was young, his beard just beginning to\n",
      "grow, red-faced, quiet and rather indolent-looking. He seemed\n",
      "completely indifferent, even though showers of spray blew, one after\n",
      "another, straight into his face.\n",
      "\n",
      "The third member of the crew lay down across the boat behind the\n",
      "thwart; he put a folded oilskin jacket under his head and fell\n",
      "asleep.\n",
      "\n",
      "For a long time, almost an hour, I lay in silence, thinking only of\n",
      "what I saw and heard around me. There was more than enough to keep\n",
      "me awake.\n",
      "\n",
      "I noticed how the sail billowed out, full of wind, pulling hard at\n",
      "the clew-line, which was made fast to the gunwhale beside Hrolfur.\n",
      "The fore-sail resembled a beautifully curved sheet of steel, stiff\n",
      "and unyielding. Both sails were snow-white, semi-transparent and\n",
      "supple in movement, like the ivory sails on the model ships in\n",
      "Rosenborg Palace. The mast seemed to bend slightly and the stays\n",
      "were as taut as fiddle-strings. The boat quivered like a leaf. The\n",
      "waves pounded hard against the thin strakes of the boat's side. I\n",
      "could feel them on my cheek, though their dampness never penetrated;\n",
      "but in between these hammer blows their little pats were wonderfully\n",
      "friendly. Every now and then I could see the white frothing of the\n",
      "wave-crests above the gunwale, and sometimes under the sail the\n",
      "horizon was visible but, more often, there was nothing to be seen\n",
      "but the broad back of a wave, on which, for a time, the boat tossed\n",
      "before sinking down once more. The roll was scarcely noticeable, for\n",
      "the boat kept at the same angle all the time and cleft her way\n",
      "through the waves. The motion was comfortable and soothing to the\n",
      "mind; quite unlike the violent lunging of bigger ships.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gradually the conversation came to life again. It was Eric who\n",
      "proved to be the most talkative, though the man on the thwart also\n",
      "threw in a word here and there.\n",
      "\n",
      "We began to talk about old Hrolfur.\n",
      "\n",
      "We spoke in a low voice so that he shouldn't hear what we said.\n",
      "There was, indeed, little danger of his doing so--the distance was\n",
      "too great and the storm was bound to carry our words away; but men\n",
      "always lower their voices when they speak of those they can see,\n",
      "even though they are speaking well of them.\n",
      "\n",
      "My eyes scarcely left old Hrolfur, and as the men told me more, my\n",
      "picture of him became clearer and clearer.\n",
      "\n",
      "He sat there silent, holding on to the steering ropes and staring\n",
      "straight ahead, not deigning us a single glance.\n",
      "\n",
      "The crew's story was roughly this.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was born and bred in the village, and he had never left it. The\n",
      "croft which he lived in was just opposite the weir in the river\n",
      "which flowed through the village, and was named after it.\n",
      "\n",
      "He went to sea whenever possible; fished for shark in the spring and\n",
      "for cod and haddock in the other seasons. He never felt so happy as\n",
      "when he was on the sea; and if he couldn't go to sea, he sat alone\n",
      "at home in the croft mending his gear. He never went down to the\n",
      "harbour for work like the other fishermen and never worked on the\n",
      "land. Humming away and talking to himself he fiddled about in his\n",
      "shed, around his boat-house or his croft, his hands all grubby with\n",
      "tar and grease. If addressed, he was abrupt and curt in his answers,\n",
      "sometimes even abusive. Hardly anyone dared go near him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet everyone liked him really. Everyone who got to know him said\n",
      "that he improved on acquaintance. His eccentricity increased as he\n",
      "grew older, but particularly after he had lost his son.\n",
      "\n",
      "His son was already grown-up and had been a most promising young\n",
      "fellow. He was thought to be the most daring of all the skippers in\n",
      "the village and always went furthest out to sea; he was also the\n",
      "most successful fisherman of them all. But one day a sudden storm\n",
      "had caught them far out to sea, well outside the mouth of the fjord.\n",
      "Rowing hard, in the teeth of wind and tide, they managed to reach\n",
      "the cliffs, but by that time they were quite exhausted. Their idea\n",
      "had been to land at Mular Creek, but unfortunately their boat\n",
      "overturned as they tried to enter. Hrolfur's son and one other on\n",
      "board had been drowned, though the rest were saved.\n",
      "\n",
      "After the disaster Hrolfur ignored everybody for a long time. It\n",
      "wasn't that he wept or lost heart. Perhaps he had done so for the\n",
      "first few days, but not afterwards. He just kept to himself. He took\n",
      "not the slightest notice of his wife and his other children, just as\n",
      "if they were no longer his concern. It was as though he felt he'd\n",
      "lost everything. He lived all alone with his sorrow and talked of it\n",
      "to no one. Nobody tried to question him; no one dared try to comfort\n",
      "him. Then, one winter, he started talking to himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Day and night, for a long time, he talked to himself, talked as\n",
      "though two or more men were chatting together, changing his tone of\n",
      "voice and acting in every way as though he were taking part in a\n",
      "lively and interesting conversation. There was nothing silly in what\n",
      "he said, although the subject matter was often difficult to follow.\n",
      "He would always answer if anyone spoke to him, slowly to be sure,\n",
      "but always sensibly and agreeably. Often, before he could answer, it\n",
      "was as though he had to wake up as from a sleep, and yet his work\n",
      "never suffered from these bouts of absentmindedness.\n",
      "\n",
      "He never talked about his son. The conversations he held with\n",
      "himself were mostly concerned with various adventures he thought had\n",
      "befallen him; some were exaggerated, others pure invention.\n",
      "Sometimes he would talk of things he was going to do in the future,\n",
      "or things he would have done or ought to have in the past, but never\n",
      "about the present.\n",
      "\n",
      "It wasn't long before the rumour spread that old Hrolfur was crazy,\n",
      "and for a long time hardly anyone dared to go to sea with him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, that's all a thing of the past, said Eric and smiled. Nowadays\n",
      "there are always more who would like to go with him than he can\n",
      "take.\n",
      "\n",
      "And does he catch plenty of fish?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, he rarely fails.\n",
      "\n",
      "Isn't he quite well-off then?\n",
      "\n",
      "I don't know. At any rate he's not dependent on anyone else, and\n",
      "he's the sole owner of his boat and tackle.\n",
      "\n",
      "He's rolling in money, the old devil, said the man at the mast,\n",
      "wiping the spray from his face with his hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then they began to tell me about Mular Island and the life they\n",
      "would lead there in the coming week.\n",
      "\n",
      "The island was a barren rock beyond the cliffs, and, in the autumn\n",
      "storms, was almost covered by the waves. The first thing they'd have\n",
      "to do, when they arrived, was to rebuild their refuge from the year\n",
      "before, roof it over with bits of driftwood and cover them with\n",
      "seaweed. That was to be their shelter at night, no matter what the\n",
      "weather. Nature had provided a landing-place, so that they'd no\n",
      "trouble with that, though the spot was so treacherous that one of\n",
      "them would have to stand watch over the boat every night.\n",
      "\n",
      "Each evening they would row off from the island with their lines to\n",
      "some well-known fishing bank, for it was after midnight that the\n",
      "shark was most eager to take the bait. Savouring in his nostrils the\n",
      "smell of horse flesh soaked in rum and of rotten seal blubber, he\n",
      "would rush on the scent and greedily swallow whatever was offered.\n",
      "When he realised the sad truth that a huge hook with a strong barb\n",
      "was hidden inside this tempting dish and that it was no easy matter\n",
      "to disgorge the tasty morsel, he would try to gnaw through the shaft\n",
      "of the hook with his teeth. Very occasionally he might succeed, but\n",
      "usually his efforts failed. Attached to the hook was a length of\n",
      "strong iron chain; and sometimes, though defeated by the hook, he\n",
      "would manage to snip through the chain. Then, in his joy at being\n",
      "free, this creature with the magnificent appetite would immediately\n",
      "rush to the next hook, only to be caught there when the lines were\n",
      "drawn in. If the shark failed in his efforts to gnaw himself free,\n",
      "he would try, by twisting and turning, to break either the hook or\n",
      "the chain; but man had foreseen this possibility and had made the\n",
      "hook to turn with him. With exemplary patience 'the grey one' would\n",
      "continue his twisting until he had been drawn right up to the side\n",
      "of the boat and a second hook made fast in him. His sea-green,\n",
      "light-shy, pig-like eyes would glare malevolently up at his\n",
      "tormentors, and in his maddened fury he would bite, snap and fight\n",
      "until he almost capsized the boat.\n",
      "\n",
      "For centuries our forefathers had hunted the shark like this in open\n",
      "boats, but nowadays men preferred to use decked vessels. No one in\n",
      "the district still used the old method, apart from old Hrolfur.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had dragged in many a 'grey one'. From the bottom of the boat\n",
      "Eric picked up one of the hooks and passed it to me; it was of\n",
      "wrought iron, half an inch thick, with a point of cast steel. But\n",
      "the spinning joint was almost chewed through and the hook shaft\n",
      "bitten and gnawed--the 'grey one' had fought hard that time.\n",
      "\n",
      "The crew told me so much about their fishing adventures that I\n",
      "longed to go to the island with them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Suddenly Eric gave me a nudge.\n",
      "\n",
      "The conversation stopped, and we all looked back at old Hrolfur.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now he's talking to himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "We all held our breath and listened.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hrolfur sat like a statue, holding the rudder-lines. His eyes wore a\n",
      "far-away look and a curious smile of happiness played over his face.\n",
      "\n",
      "After a short silence, he spoke again--in a perfectly normal voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I was on the frigate--\n",
      "\n",
      "For the time being that was all.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a touch of vanity in his smile, as though in memory of\n",
      "some old, half-ludicrous story from the past.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, when I was on the frigate, my lad--\n",
      "\n",
      "It was just as if there were someone sitting next to him beside the\n",
      "rudder, to whom he was relating his adventures.\n",
      "\n",
      "Has he ever been on a warship? I whispered.\n",
      "\n",
      "Never in his life, said Eric.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our eyes never left him. I can still remember the curious twitching\n",
      "and working of his features. The eyes themselves were invisible; it\n",
      "was as though the man were asleep. But his forehead and temples were\n",
      "forever on the move, as if in mimicry of what he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "I couldn't utter a sound. Everything was blurred before my eyes, for\n",
      "it was only then that the full realisation came upon me that the man\n",
      "at the rudder--the man who held all our lives in his hands--was\n",
      "half-crazed.\n",
      "\n",
      "The crew nudged each other and chortled. They'd seen all this\n",
      "before.\n",
      "\n",
      "She was running aground--heading straight for the reef,--a total\n",
      "loss, said Hrolfur, a total loss, I tell you. She was a beautiful\n",
      "craft, shining black and diced with white along the sides--ten\n",
      "fighting mouths on either side and a carved figure on her prow. I\n",
      "think the king would have been sorry to lose her. She was far too\n",
      "lovely to be ground to pieces there--they were glad when I turned\n",
      "up.\n",
      "\n",
      "The crew did their best to smother their laughter.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Top-sails up,' I shouted.--'Top-sails up, my lad.' The officer, for\n",
      "all his gold braid, went as pale as death. 'Top-sails up, in the\n",
      "devil's name.' The blue-jackets on the deck fell over themselves in\n",
      "fear. Yes, my lad, even though I hadn't a sword dangling by my side,\n",
      "I said, 'Top-sails up, in the devil's name.' And they obeyed me--\n",
      "they obeyed me. They didn't dart not to. 'Top-sails up, in the\n",
      "devil's name.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Hrolfur raised himself up on the crossbeam, his fists clenched round\n",
      "the steering-ropes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Eric was almost bursting with laughter and trying hard not to let it\n",
      "be heard; but the man at the mast made little attempt to stifle his.\n",
      "\n",
      "She's made it, said Hrolfur, his face all smiles and nodding his\n",
      "head.--Out to sea. Straight out to sea. Let her lie down a bit, if\n",
      "she wants to. It'll do her no harm to ship a drop or two. Let it\n",
      "'bubble up over her rowlocks,' as we Icelanders say. Even though she\n",
      "creaks a bit, it's all to the good. Her planks aren't rotten when\n",
      "they make that noise. All right, we'll sail the bottom out of her--\n",
      "but forward she'll go--forward, forward she shall go!\n",
      "\n",
      "Hrolfur let his voice drop and drew out his jet words slowly.\n",
      "\n",
      "By now we were far out in the fjord. The sea was rising and becoming\n",
      "more choppy because of tide currents. Good steering became more and more\n",
      "difficult. Hrolfur seemed to do it instinctively. He never once looked\n",
      "up and yet seemed to see all around him. He seemed to sense the approach\n",
      "of those bigger waves which had to be avoided or passed by. The general\n",
      "direction was never lost, but the boat ran wonderfully smoothly in and\n",
      "out of the waves--over them, before them and through them, as though she\n",
      "were possessed with human understanding. Not a single wave fell on her;\n",
      "they towered high above, advanced on her foaming and raging, but\n",
      "somehow--at the last moment--she turned aside. She was as sensitive as a\n",
      "frightened hind, quick to answer the rudder, as supple in her movements\n",
      "as a willing racehorse. Over her reigned the spirit of Hrolfur.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Hrolfur himself was no longer there. He was 'on the frigate'. It\n",
      "was not his own boat he was steering in that hour, but a huge three-\n",
      "master with a whole cloud of sails above her and ten cannon on\n",
      "either side--a miracle of the shipwright's craft. The mainstays were\n",
      "of many-stranded steelwire, the halyards, all clustered together,\n",
      "struck at the mast and stays; they seemed inextricably tangled, and\n",
      "yet were in fact all ship-shape, taut and true, like the nerves in a\n",
      "human body. There was no need to steer her enormous bulk to avoid\n",
      "the waves or pass them by; it was enough to let her crush them with\n",
      "all her weight, let her grind them down and push them before her\n",
      "like drifts of snow. Groaning and creaking she ploughed straight on\n",
      "through all that came against her, heeling before the wind right\n",
      "down to her gunwale and leaving behind her a long furrow in the sea.\n",
      "High above the deck of this magnificent vessel, between two curved\n",
      "iron pillars, Hrolfur's boat hung like a tiny mussel shell.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once upon a time this had been a dream of the future. But now that\n",
      "all hope of its fulfilment had been lost, the dream had long since\n",
      "become a reality. Hrolfur's adventure 'on the frigate' was a thing\n",
      "of the past.\n",
      "\n",
      "For a long time he continued talking to himself, talked of how he\n",
      "had brought 'the frigate' safely to harbour, and how he had been\n",
      "awarded a 'gold medal' by the king. We could hear only anppets of\n",
      "this long rigmarole, but we never lost the drift of it. He spoke\n",
      "alternately in Danish and Icelandic, in many different tones of\n",
      "voice, and one could always tell, by the way he spoke, where he was\n",
      "in 'the frigate': whether he was addressing the crew on the deck, or\n",
      "the officers on the bridge, and when, his fantastic feat\n",
      "accomplished, he clinked glasses with them in the cabin on the poop.\n",
      "\n",
      "The wind had slackened somewhat, but now that we had reached so far\n",
      "out into the bay the waves were higher; they were the remains of the\n",
      "huge ocean waves which raged on the high seas, remains which,\n",
      "despite the adverse wind, made their way far up the fjord.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hrolfur no longer talked aloud, but he continued to hum quietly to\n",
      "himself. The crew around me began to doze off, and I think even I\n",
      "was almost asleep for a time. To tell the truth I wasn't very far\n",
      "from feeling seasick.\n",
      "\n",
      "Soon afterwards the man who had been asleep in the space behind the\n",
      "mast rose to his feet, yawned once or twice, shook himself to\n",
      "restore his circulation and looked around.\n",
      "\n",
      "It won't be long now before we get to Mular Creek, he said with his\n",
      "mouth still wide-open.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was wide awake at once when I heard this, and raised myself up on\n",
      "my elbow. The mountain I had seen from the village--which then had\n",
      "been wrapped in a dark haze--now towered directly above us, rocky\n",
      "and enormous, with black sea-crags at its feet. The rocks were\n",
      "drenched with spray from the breakers, and the booming of the sea as\n",
      "it crashed into the basalt caves resounded like the roar of cannon.\n",
      "\n",
      "There'll be no landing in the creek today, Hrolfur, the man said and\n",
      "yawned again. The breakers are too heavy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hrolfur pretended he hadn't heard.\n",
      "\n",
      "Everybody aboard was awake now and watching the shore; and I think\n",
      "he was not the only one amongst us to shudder at the thought of\n",
      "landing.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the mountain in front of us it was as though a panel was slowly\n",
      "moved to one side: the valleys of Muladalir opened up before us.\n",
      "Soon we glimpsed the roofs of the farms up on the hill-side. The\n",
      "beach itself was covered with rocks.\n",
      "\n",
      "The boat turned into the inlet. It was quieter there than outside,\n",
      "and the sea was just a little another.\n",
      "\n",
      "Loosen the foresail, Hrolfur ordered. It was Eric who obeyed and\n",
      "held on to the sheet Hrolfur himself untied the mainsail, whilst at\n",
      "the same time keeping hold of the sheet. I imagined Hrolfur must be\n",
      "thinking it safer to have the sails loose as it was likely to be\n",
      "gusty in the inlet.\n",
      "\n",
      "Are you going to sail in? said the man who'd been asleep. His voice\n",
      "came through a nose filled with snuff.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shut up, said Hrolfur savagely.\n",
      "\n",
      "The man took the hint and asked no more questions. No one asked a\n",
      "question, though every moment now was one of suspense.\n",
      "\n",
      "We all gazed in silence at the cliffs, which were lathered in white\n",
      "foam.\n",
      "\n",
      "One wave after another passed under the boat. They lifted her high\n",
      "up, as if to show us the surf. As the boat sank slowly down into the\n",
      "trough of the wave, the surf disappeared and with it much of the\n",
      "shore. The wave had shut it out.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was surprised how little the boat moved, but an explanation of the\n",
      "mystery was soon forthcoming: the boat and all she carried were\n",
      "still subject to Hrolfur's will.\n",
      "\n",
      "He let the wind out of the mainsail and, by careful manipulation of\n",
      "the rudder, kept the boat wonderfully still. He was standing up now\n",
      "in front of the crossbeam and staring fixedly out in front of the\n",
      "boat. He was no longer talking to himself, he was no longer 'on the\n",
      "frigate', but in his own boat; he knew well how much depended on\n",
      "him.\n",
      "\n",
      "After waiting for a while, watching his opportunity, Hrolfur\n",
      "suddenly let her go at full speed once more.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now the moment had come--a moment I shall never forget--nor probably\n",
      "any of us who were in the boat with him. It was not fear that\n",
      "gripped us but something more like excitement before a battle. Yet,\n",
      "if the choice had been mine, we should have turned back from the\n",
      "creek that day.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hrolfur stood at the rudder, immovable, his eyes shifting from side\n",
      "to side, now under the sail, now past it. He chewed vigorously on\n",
      "his quid of tobacco and spat. There was much less sign now of the\n",
      "twitchings round his eyes than there'd been earlier in the day, and\n",
      "his very calmness had a soothing effect on us all.\n",
      "\n",
      "As we approached the creek, a huge wave rose up behind us. Hrolfur\n",
      "glanced at it with the corner of his eye. He spat and bared his\n",
      "teeth. The wave rose and rose, and it reached us just at the mouth\n",
      "of the creek, its overhanging peak so sharp as to be almost\n",
      "transparent. It seemed to be making straight for the boat.\n",
      "\n",
      "As I watched, I felt the boat plummet down, as if the sea was\n",
      "snatched from under her; it was the undertow--the wave was drawing\n",
      "the waters back beneath it. By the gunwale the blue-green sea\n",
      "frothed white as it poured back from the skerries near the entrance\n",
      "to the creek.\n",
      "\n",
      "The boat almost stood on end; it was as if the sea was boiling\n",
      "around us--boiling until the very seaweed on the rocks was turned to\n",
      "broth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Suddenly an ice-cold lash, as of a whip, seemed to strike me in the\n",
      "face. I staggered forwards under the blow and grasped at one of the\n",
      "mainstays.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let go the foresail, shouted Hrolfur.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I was able to look up, the sails were flapping idly over the\n",
      "gunwale. The boat floated gently into the creek, thwart-deep in\n",
      "water.\n",
      "\n",
      "We all felt fine.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's true, I could feel the cold sea water dripping down my bare\n",
      "back, underneath my shirt, but I didn't mind. All that had happened\n",
      "to me was but a kiss, given me in token of farewell by the youngest\n",
      "daughter of the goddess of the waves.\n",
      "\n",
      "The boat floated slowly in on the unaccustomed calm of the waters\n",
      "and stopped at the landing-place.\n",
      "\n",
      "Standing there watching were two men from the farm.\n",
      "\n",
      "I thought as much, it had to be old Hrolfur, one of them called out\n",
      "as we landed. It's no ordinary man's job to get into the creek on a\n",
      "day like this.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hrolfur's face was wreathed in smiles: he made no answer, but\n",
      "slipping off the rudder in case it should touch bottom he laid it\n",
      "down across the stern.\n",
      "\n",
      "We were given a royal welcome by the fanners from Mular, and all\n",
      "that I needed to further me on my journey was readily available and\n",
      "willingly granted. Nowhere does Iceland's hospitality flourish so\n",
      "well as in her outlying stations and in the remotest of her valleys,\n",
      "where travellers are few.\n",
      "\n",
      "We all got out of the boat and pulled her clear of the waves. Every\n",

      "fragments amongst the lumpy masses of snow below highwatermark, his\n",
      "frown deepened, but he did not say anything.\n",
      "\n",

      "than to be slipped into the ground at the expense of the parish.\n",
      "Fortunately his prospects weren't so bad, he had said. They could\n",
      "both die peacefully whenever the time came--there was the cabin, the\n",
      "boat, the tools and other gear, and finally the land itself--these\n",
      "would surely fetch enough to meet the cost of coffin and funeral\n",
      "service, as well as a cup of coffee for anyone who would put himself\n",
      "out so far as to accept their hospitality on that occasion. But now,\n",
      "contrary to custom, his father had not proved an oracle--he was dead\n",
      "and everything else had gone with him--except the land on the Point.\n",
      "And how was that to be turned into cash when there was no cabin on\n",

      "be simplest to run down to the shore and throw himself in the sea?\n",

      "parish. There were only his shoulders to carry the burden. If they\n",
      "both rested in a shameful grave, it would be his fault--he hadn't\n",
      "the heart to do it.\n",
      "\n",

      "be within four walls,--covered them over and filled the gaps with\n",
      "bits of sail-cloth and anything else handy, and finished by\n",
      "shovelling snow up over the whole structure. Before long it was\n",
      "rather better in the cave than out-of-doors, though the most\n",
      "important thing was to have Snjolfur with him for his last days\n",
      "above ground--it might be a week or more. It was no easy matter to\n",

      "any rate for a start. His drowsiness fell from him, he slipped out\n",
      "of the cave and strode off towards the village.\n",

      "you know, I've lost Snjolfur--and the boat. I don't think there's\n",
      "any hope of putting the bits of her together again. Now that I've no\n",
      "boat, I thought I might let out the landing-place, if I could make\n",
      "something out of it. The Faroese would be sure to give me something\n",
      "for the pot if I gave them a hand with launching and unloading. They\n",
      "could row most ways from there--I'm not exaggerating--they had to\n",
      "stay at home time and time again last summer, when it was easy for\n",
      "Snjolfur and me to put off. There's a world of difference between a\n",
      "deep-water landing-place and a shallow-water one--that's what\n",
      "Snjolfur said many a time.\n",
      "\n",
      "The factor asked his visitor what price he had thought of putting on\n",
      "it for the summer. I don't know what the funeral will cost yet,\n",
      "replied the orphan in worried tones. At any rate I should need\n",
      "enough to pay for Snjolfur's funeral. Then I should count myself\n",
      "lucky.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then let's say that, struck in the factor, and went on to say that\n",
      "he would see about the coffin and everything--there was no need for\n",
      "little Snjolfur to fret about it any more. Without thinking, he\n",
      "found himself opening the door for his guest, diminutive though he\n",
      "was,--but the boy stood there as if he had not seen him do it, and\n",
      "it was written clear on his face that he had not yet finished the\n",
      "business that brought him; the anxious look was still strong on his\n",
      "ruddy face, firm-featured beyond his years.\n",
      "\n",
      "When are you expecting the ship with your stores?\n",
      "\n",
      "The factor replied that it would hardly come tomorrow, perhaps the\n",
      "day after. It was a puzzle to know why the boy had asked--the pair\n",
      "of them, father and son, did not usually ask about his stores until\n",
      "they brought the cash to buy them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Little Snjolfur did not take his eyes from the factor's face. The\n",
      "words stuck in his throat, but at last he managed to get his\n",
      "question out: In that case, wouldn't the factor be needing a boy to\n",
      "help in the store?\n",
      "\n",
      "The factor did not deny it.\n",
      "\n",
      "But he ought to be past his confirmation for preference, he added\n",
      "with a smile.\n",
      "\n",
      "It looked as if little Snjolfur was ready for this answer, and\n",
      "indeed his errand was now at an end, but he asked the factor to come\n",
      "out with him round the corner of the store. They went out, the boy\n",
      "in front, and onto the pebble-bank nearby. The boy stopped at a\n",
      "stone lying there, got a grip of it, lifted it without any obvious\n",
      "exertion and heaved it away from him. Then he turned to the factor.\n",
      "\n",
      "We call this stone the Weakling. The boy you had last summer\n",
      "couldn't lift it high enough to let the damp in underneath--much\n",
      "less any further!\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh, well then, seeing you are stronger than he was, it ought to be\n",
      "possible to make use of you in some way, even though you are on the\n",
      "wrong side of confirmation, replied the factor in a milder tone.\n",
      "\n",
      "Do I get my keep while I'm with you? And the same wages as he had?\n",
      "continued the youngster, who was the sort that likes to know where\n",
      "he stands in good time.\n",
      "\n",
      "But of course, answered the factor, who for once was in no mood to\n",
      "drive a hard bargain.\n",
      "\n",
      "That's good--then I shan't go on the parish, said little Snjolfur,\n",
      "and was easier in his mind. The man who has got something to pot in\n",
      "himself and on himself isn't a pauper,--Snjolfur often used to say\n",
      "that, he added, and he straightened himself up proudly and offered\n",
      "his hand to the factor, just as he had seen his father do. Good-bye,\n",
      "he said. I shall come then--not tomorrow but the day after.\n",
      "\n",
      "The factor told him to come in again for a minute and leading the\n",
      "way to the kitchen-door he ushered little Snjolfur into the warmth.\n",
      "He asked the cook if she couldn't give this nipper here a bite of\n",
      "something to eat, preferably something warm--he could do with it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Little Snjolfur would not accept any food.\n",
      "\n",
      "Aren't you hungry? asked the astonished factor.\n",
      "\n",
      "The boy could not deny that he was--and for the rest he could hardly\n",
      "get his words out with the sharpness of his hunger whetted still\n",
      "keener by the blessed smell of cooking. But he resisted the\n",
      "temptation:\n",
      "\n",
      "I am not a beggar, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "The factor was upset and he saw that he had set about it clumsily.\n",
      "He went over to the dogged youngster, patted his head and, with a\n",
      "nod to the cook, led little Snjolfur into the dining-room.\n",
      "\n",
      "Have you never seen your father give his visitors a drink or offer\n",
      "them a cup of coffee when they came to see him? he asked, and he\n",
      "gave his words a resentful tone.\n",
      "\n",
      "Little Snjolfur had to confess that his father had sometimes offered\n",
      "hospitality to a visitor.\n",
      "\n",
      "There you are then, said the factor. It's just ordinary good manners\n",
      "to offer hospitality--and to accept it. Refusing a well-meant\n",
      "invitation for no reason can mean the end of a friendship. You are a\n",
      "visitor here, so naturally I offer you something to eat: we have\n",
      "made an important deal and, what's more, we have come to terms over\n",
      "a job. If you won't accept ordinary hospitality, it's hard to see\n",
      "how the rest is going to work out.\n",
      "\n",
      "The boy sighed: of course, it must be as the factor said. But he was\n",
      "in a hurry. Snjolfur was by himself out on the Point. His eyes\n",
      "wandered round the room--then he added, very seriously: The point is\n",
      "to pay your debts, not owe anybody anything, and trust in\n",
      "Providence.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was never a truer word spoken, agreed the factor, and as he\n",
      "said it he pulled his handkerchief out of his pocket. He's a chip of\n",
      "the old block, he muttered, and putting his hand on little\n",
      "Snjolfur's shoulder, he blessed him.\n",
      "\n",
      "The boy was astonished to see a grown man with tears in his eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Snjolfur never cried, he said, and went on: I haven't cried either\n",
      "since I was little--I nearly did when I knew Snjolfur was dead. But\n",
      "I was afraid he wouldn't like it, and I stopped myself.\n",
      "\n",
      "A moment later and tears overwhelmed little Snjolfur.--It is a\n",

      "No need to take care now about fastening the door, Arni of Bali said\n",
      "to himself as he wrapped the string around the nail driven into the\n",
      "door-post of the outlying sheepcote. Then he turned around, took out\n",
      "his handkerchief, and, putting it to his nose, blew vigorously. This\n",
      "done, he folded the handkerchief together again, wiped his mouth and\n",
      "nose, and took out his snuff horn.\n",
      "\n",
      "What fine balmy weather, thought Arni. That miserable fox won't come\n",
      "near sheepcotes or houses now. Blast its hide! Yes, it had caused\n",
      "him many a wakeful night. All the neighbouring farmers would have\n",
      "the fool's luck to catch a fox every single winter. All but him. He\n",
      "couldn't even wound a vixen, and had in all his life never caught\n",
      "any kind of fox. Wouldn't it be fun to bring home a dark brown pelt,\n",
      "one with fine overhair? Yes, wouldn't that be fun? Arni shook his\n",
      "head in delight, cleared his throat vigorously, and took a pinch of\n",
      "snuff.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bending his steps homeward, he tottered along with his body half\n",
      "stooped, as was his habit, and his hands behind his back. When he\n",
      "looked up, he did not straighten out, but bent his neck back so his\n",
      "head lay between his shoulder blades. Then his red-rimmed eyes\n",
      "looked as if they were about to pop out of his head, his dark red\n",
      "beard rose up as though striving to free itself from its roots, and\n",
      "his empurpled nose and scarlet cheek-bones protruded.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pretty good under foot, thought Arni. At least it was easy to go\n",
      "between the sheepcotes and the house. Everything pretty quiet just\n",
      "now. The sheep took care of themselves during the day, and grazing\n",
      "was plentiful along the seashore and on the hillsides. No reason why\n",
      "he might not now and then lie in wait somewhat into the night in the\n",
      "hope of catching a fox; he wasn't too tired for that. But he had\n",
      "given up all that sort of thing. It brought only vexation and\n",
      "trouble. Besides, he had told everybody that he did not think it\n",
      "worth his while to waste his time on such things and perhaps catch\n",
      "his death to boot. The Lord knew that was mere pretence. Eighty\n",
      "crowns for a beautiful, dark brown fox skin was a tidy sum! But a\n",
      "man had to think up something to say for himself, the way they all\n",
      "harped on fox-hunting: Bjarni of Fell caught a white vixen night\n",
      "before last, or Einar of Brekka caught a brown dog-fox yesterday. Or\n",
      "if a man stepped over to a neighbour's for a moment: Any hunting?\n",
      "Anyone shot a fox? Our Gisli here caught a grayish brown one last\n",
      "evening. Such incessant twaddle!\n",
      "\n",
      "Arni's breath came short. Wasn't it enough if a man made an honest\n",
      "living? Yet, work or achievement which brought no joy was unblessed.\n",
      "At this point Samur darted up. Arni thought the dog had deserted him\n",
      "and rushed off home. Now, what in the world ailed the creature?\n",
      "Shame on you for a pesky cur! Can't you be still a minute, you\n",
      "brute? Must I beat you? asked Arni, making threatening gestures at\n",
      "Samur, a large, black-spotted dog with ugly, shaggy hair. But Samur\n",
      "darted away, ran off whimpering; he would pause now and then and\n",
      "look back at his master, until finally he disappeared behind a big\n",
      "boulder.\n",
      "\n",
      "What's got into the beast? He can't have found a fox trail, can he?\n",
      "\n",
      "Arni walked straight to the rock where Samur had disappeared; then\n",
      "slowing down his pace, he tiptoed as if he expected to find a fox\n",
      "hidden there. Yes, there was Samur. There he lay in front of a hole,\n",
      "whimpering and wagging his tail.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shame on you, Samur!\n",
      "\n",
      "Arni lay down prone on the snow and stretched his arm into the hole.\n",
      "But all of a sudden he jerked his hand back, his heart beating as if\n",
      "it would tear itself out of his breast. He had so plainly felt\n",
      "something furry inside the hole, and he was badly mistaken if a\n",
      "strong fox odour did not come out of it. Was the fox alive, or was\n",
      "it dead? Might it bite him fatally? But that made no difference. Now\n",
      "that he had a good chance of taking a fox, it was do or die. He\n",
      "stood up straight and stretched every muscle, and pulled the mitten\n",
      "on his right hand carefully up over his wrist. Then he knelt down,\n",
      "thrust his hand in the hole, set his teeth, and screwed up his face.\n",
      "Yes, now he had caught hold of it and was pulling it carefully out.\n",
      "Well, well, well, well! Not so bad! A dark brown tail, a glossy\n",
      "body, and what fine over-hair! For once Arni of Bali had some luck!\n",
      "The fox was dead; it had been shot in the belly and just crept in\n",
      "there to die. Sly devil! Poor beast! Blessed creature! Arni ended by\n",
      "feeling quite tenderly towards the fox. He hardly knew how to give\n",
      "utterance to his joy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Good old Samur, my own precious dog, let me pat you, said Arni,\n",
      "rubbing the dog's cheek with his own. They could shout themselves\n",
      "blue in the face. It was no trick to kill all you wanted of these\n",
      "little devils if you just had the powder and shot and were willing\n",
      "to waste your time on it. But here Arni's face fell. He did not even\n",
      "have his gun with him. It stood, all covered with rust, at home out\n",
      "in the shed. Just his luck! And how could he claim to have shot a\n",
      "fox without a gun?--Get out of here, Samur. Shame on you, you\n",
      "rascal!--And Arni booted Samur so hard that the dog yelped.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, in direst need, help is at hand. He could wait for the cover of\n",
      "darkness. Not even his wife should know but that he had shot the\n",
      "fox. Wouldn't she stare at him? She had always defied him and tried\n",
      "to belittle him. No, she should not learn the truth, she least of\n",
      "all. He would not tell a soul. Now Samur, he knew how to hold his\n",
      "tongue, faithful creature! Arni sat down on the rock, with the fox\n",
      "on his knees, and started singing to pass the time, allowing his\n",
      "good cheer to ring out as far as his voice would carry:\n",
      "\n",
      "     My fine Sunday cap has been carried away\n",
      "      By a furious gale;\n",

      "      In the wind and the hail.\n",
      "\n",
      "He chanted this ballad over and over again until he was tired, then\n",
      "sat still, smiling and stroking the fox skin. He had learned the\n",
      "song when he was a child from his mother, who had sung it all day\n",
      "long one spring while she was shearing the sheep. And he could not\n",
      "think of any other for the moment. It wasn't, in fact, a bad song.\n",
      "There were many good rhymesters in Iceland. He began singing again,\n",
      "rocking his body back and forth vehemently, and stroking the fox\n",
      "skin the while. And Samur, who sat in front of him, cocked his head\n",
      "first on one side, then on the other, and gave him a knowing look.\n",
      "At last the dog stretched out his neck, raised his muzzle into the\n",
      "air and howled, using every variation of key known to him. At this\n",
      "Arni stopped short and stared at him, then bending his head slightly\n",
      "to one side to study him, he roared with laughter.\n",
      "\n",
      "What an extraordinary dog! Yes, really extraordinary.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the little kitchen at Bali, Groa, the mistress, crouched before\n",
      "the stove and poked the fire with such vigour that both ashes and\n",
      "embers flew out on the floor. She was preparing to heat a mouthful\n",
      "of porridge for supper for her old man and the brats. She stood up,\n",
      "rubbed her eyes and swore. The horrid smoke that always came from\n",
      "that rattletrap of a stove! And that wretched old fool of a husband\n",
      "was not man enough to fix it! Oh, no, he wasn't handy enough for\n",
      "that; he went at every blessed thing as if his fingers were all\n",
      "thumbs. And where could he be loafing tonight? Not home yet! Serve\n",
      "him right if she locked the house and allowed him to stay in the\n",
      "sheepcotes, or wherever it was he was dawdling. There now, those\n",
      "infernal brats were at the spinning wheel. Groa jumped up, darted\n",
      "into the passage, and went to the stairs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Will you leave that spinning wheel be, you young devils? If you\n",
      "break the flier or the upright, your little old mother will be after\n",
      "you.\n",
      "\n",
      "A dead calm ensued. So Groa returned to the kitchen, and taking a\n",
      "loaf of pot-bread from the cupboard, cut a few slices and spread\n",
      "them with dripping.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now a scratching sound was heard at the door, and Arni entered.\n",
      "\n",
      "Good evening to all, said he with urbanity, as he set down the gun\n",
      "behind the kitchen door. Here's that gun. It has certainly paid for\n",
      "itself, poor old thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "His wife did not reply to his greeting, but she eyed him askance\n",
      "with a look that was anything but loving.\n",
      "\n",
      "Been fooling around with that gun! Why the blazes couldn't you have\n",
      "come home and brought me a bit of peat from the pit? A fine hunter\n",
      "you are! I might as well have married the devil.--And his wife\n",
      "turned from him with a sneer.\n",
      "\n",
      "You're in a nice temper now, my dear. But just take a look at this,\n",
      "said Arni, throwing down the brown fox on the kitchen floor.\n",
      "\n",
      "At first Groa stared at her husband as if she had never seen him\n",
      "before. Then she shook her head and smiled sarcastically.\n",
      "\n",
      "You found it dead, I'll wager!\n",
      "\n",
      "Arni started. His face turned red and his eyes protruded.\n",
      "\n",
      "You would say that! You don't let me forget what a superior woman I\n",
      "married! Found it dead!--And Arni plumped down on the woodbox.\n",
      "\n",
      "His wife laughed.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'll wager I hit the nail on the head that time!\n",
      "\n",
      "Arni jumped to his feet. That confounded old witch should not spoil\n",
      "his pleasure.\n",
      "\n",
      "You're as stark, raving mad as you always have been. But I don't\n",
      "care what you say. Kids, come and look at the fox your father has\n",
      "shot.\n",
      "\n",
      "Three days later they had a visitor. Arni stood outside and stared\n",
      "at him. For a wonder, somebody had at last found his way to Arni's.\n",
      "Days and nights had passed, but nobody had come. They always came\n",
      "when they weren't wanted. And now came Jon of Lon, that overbearing\n",
      "fellow! But now he could see that Arni of Bali was also a man among\n",
      "men.\n",
      "\n",

      "Arni.\n",
      "\n",
      "How are you, you old snake! answered Arni, smiling contemptuously.\n",
      "What monstrous eyes Jon had when he looked at a person!\n",

      "Has something special happened? You're somehow so puffed up today,\n",

      "\n",
      "Darn him! muttered Arni. Was he going to act just like Groa? In that\n",
      "case, Arni had at least a trump card in reserve.\n",
      "\n",
      "Did you say something? inquired Jon, sticking a quid of tobacco into\n",
      "his mouth. Or wasn't it meant for my ears? Oh, well, I don't care\n",
      "for your mutterings, you poor wretch. But now, go ask your wife to\n",
      "give me a little drink of sour whey.\n",
      "\n",
      "Arni turned round slowly and lazily. Wasn't the old fellow going to\n",
      "notice the skin? It wasn't so small that it couldn't be seen. There\n",
      "it hung on the wall, right in the sunlight, combed and beautifully\n",
      "glossy.\n",
      "\n",
      "That's quite a nice fox skin. Whose is it? asked Jon, walking over\n",
      "to the wall.\n",
      "\n",
      "Arni turned round. He could feel his heart beating fast.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mine, he said, with what calm he could muster.\n",
      "\n",
      "What is the idea of you buying a fox skin, you poor beggar?\n",
      "\n",
      "Buying? Arni sighed. You think I can't shoot me a fox?\n",
      "\n",
      "You! Jon laughed. That's a downright lie, my dear Arni.\n",
      "\n",
      "A lie! You'd best not tell people they lie unless you know more\n",
      "about it. A scoundrel like you, I say, a scoundrel like you! replied\n",
      "Arni, swelling. I think you'd better be getting in and see her. You\n",
      "know her pretty well, I believe.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jon looked at the farmer of Bali with his steely eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "For whom are you keeping the skin, Arni?\n",
      "\n",
      "No one, said Arni, crossly; then after some hesitation: The Lord\n",
      "gave it to me.\n",
      "\n",
      "All right, Arni. Miracles never cease. That is plain enough after\n",

      "\n",
      "Arni grinned and, trotting to the door of the house, called: Groa, a\n",

      "\n",
      "The woman came to the door. A smile played about her lips,\n",
      "smouldering embers glowed in her blue eyes, and the sunlight lighted\n",
      "up the unkempt braids of golden hair which fell down about her pale\n",
      "cheeks.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Arni for once was satisfied. At last Jon was properly impressed.\n",
      "The affair between Groa and Jon was something that could not be\n",
      "helped. Jon surely regretted having lost that girl! Yes, indeed! And\n",
      "she had her good points. She was smart, and a hundred crowns a year,\n",
      "besides everything else that was brought them from Lon, was pretty\n",
      "good compensation. Yes, many a man had married less well than Arni\n",
      "of Bali. And the children were his, most of them, anyway. Nobody\n",
      "need tell him anything else.\n",
      "\n",

      "The fox skin became Arni of Bali's most cherished possession. Every\n",
      "day, when the weather was clear, he would hang it, well smoothed and\n",
      "combed, on the outside wall, and when he left home he carefully put\n",
      "it away in a safe place. The skin became famous throughout the\n",
      "district, and many of the younger men made special trips to Bali to\n",
      "examine it. Arni would beam with joy and strut around with a\n",
      "knowing, self-satisfied expression on his face, and would tell of\n",
      "the patience, the agility, and the marksmanship he had to put into\n",
      "killing this monstrously clever fox. It certainly wasn't hard to\n",
      "kill all you wanted of these devils, if you just had the powder and\n",
      "shot and were willing to give your time to it, he would say, as he\n",
      "turned the skin so that the sunlight shone full on the glossy pelt.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then one day that fall, Arni came home from tending the sheep, which\n",
      "had just been brought down from the mountain pastures. He hung the\n",
      "skin out and went into the kitchen, where Groa was busy washing, sat\n",
      "down on a box by the wall on the other side of the room, let his\n",
      "head rest on his hands, and looked wise. For a while there was\n",
      "silence. At last Groa looked up from her washtub and gave Arni a\n",
      "piercing glance.\n",

      "So I say? Do you think the milk from Dumba alone goes very far in\n",
      "feeding such a flock of children as we have? You haven't gone and\n",
      "squandered the money we got for Skjalda? asked Groa, looking harder\n",
      "still at her husband.\n",
      "\n",
      "Don't be foolish, woman! The money lies untouched at the factor's.\n",
      "But he wouldn't pay much for the meat and hide of Skjalda, not\n",
      "anywhere near enough to buy a good milking cow. He said the English\n",
      "on the trawlers don't set much store by cow's meat. The summer has\n",
      "been only so-so, and I'm sure we'll have plenty of uses for what\n",

      "\n",
      "If you can't scrape together the money for a cow, we must cut\n",

      "kitchen floor.--An eighty-crown skin! And you call it wretched! Jon\n",
      "of Lon didn't call it any names. You'll believe at least what he\n",
      "says.\n",

      "for the skin. You can take it from me that you will never get a cow\n",
      "for that skin. Or anything else, in fact. The farmer at Lon can\n",

      "trembling with rage, he hissed:\n",
      "\n",
      "I tell you, Groa. I'll have my way about this. The skin is the only\n",
      "thing that is all my own, and no one shall take it from me.\n",

      "the key on a string which hangs around his neck. Arni now has become\n",
      "quite prosperous. For a long time it was thought that he must keep\n",

      "in America, and meet one cold winter day out in the snow. At first\n",
      "she pricked up her ears and stared at the man with brown mistrustful\n",
      "eyes. Then she crouched down in the snow and began to tremble, and\n",
      "he understood that she was telling him she wasn't feeling well, that\n",

      "Time passed on and Torfi Torfason fished in the lake and lived in a\n",

      "made money out of his fishing fleet as well as by selling other\n",
      "fishermen tobacco, liquor, and twine. The fisherman vehemently\n",
      "disliked the dog and said every day that that damned bitch ought to\n",
      "be killed. He had built this cabin on the island himself. It was\n",
      "divided into two parts, a hall and a room. They slept in the room,\n",
      "and in the hall they kept fishing tackle, food, and other supplies,\n",
      "but the bitch slept on the step outside the cabin door. The\n",
      "fisherman was not a generous man and gave Torfi the smaller share of\n",
      "the food. He absolutely forbade giving the dog the tiniest morsel\n",
      "and said that bitch ought to be killed. To this Torfi made no\n",
      "answer, but always stole a bite for the dog when the fisherman had\n",
      "gone to bed. Now the time came when the bitch was to pup. The bitch\n",
      "pupped. And when she had finished pupping, he gave her a fine chunk\n",
      "of meat, which he stole from the fisherman, for he knew that bitter\n",
      "is the hunger of the woman in child-bed, and let her lie on an old\n",
      "sack in the hall, directly against the will of the fisherman. Then\n",
      "he lay down to sleep.\n",

      "But he had not lain long when he is aroused by someone walking about\n",
      "and he cannot figure out why. But it turns out to be the fisherman,\n",
      "who gets up out of bed, walks out into the hall. lights the lamp,\n",
      "takes the bitch by the scruff of the neck, and throws her out in the\n",
      "snow. Then he closes the outer door, puts out the light, and lies\n",
      "down on his bunk. Now it is quiet for a while, until the bitch\n",
      "begins to howl outside and the pups to whine piteously in the hall.\n",
      "Then Torfi Torfason gets up, gropes his way out through the hall,\n",
      "lets the bitch in, and she crawls at once over her pups. After that\n",
      "he lies down to sleep. But he has not lain long when he is aroused\n",
      "by somebody walking about and he can not figure out why. But it\n",

      "\n",
      "Either you leave the dog alone or both of us will go, I and the dog,\n",
      "says Torfi Torfason, and it was only a matter of seconds till he\n",
      "laid hands on his master. A hard scuffle began and the cabin shook\n",
      "with it, and everything fell over and broke that was in the way.\n",
      "They gave each other many and heavy blows, but the fisherman was the\n",
      "more warlike, until Torfi tackled low, grasped him round the waist,\n",
      "and did not let up in the attack until he had the fisherman doubled\n",
      "up with his chin against his knees. Then he opened the door of the\n",
      "cabin and threw him out somewhere into the wide world.\n",
      "\n",
      "Outside, the weather was calm, the stars were shining, it was\n",
      "extremely cold, and there was snow over everything. Torfi was all\n",
      "black and blue and bleeding, hot and panting after the struggle. So\n",
      "this was what had to happen to Torfi Torfason, renowned as a man of\n",
      "peace, who had never harmed a living creature--to throw a man out of\n",
      "his own house, hurl him out on the frozen ground in the middle of\n",
      "the night, and all for one she-dog. Perhaps I have even killed him,\n",
      "Torfi thought, but that's the end of that--that's how it had to be.\n",
      "To think that I ever moved to New Iceland!\n",
      "\n",
      "And he sauntered out of the cabin, coatless as he stood, sauntered\n",
      "out on to the icy ground and headed for the woods. And he had hardly\n",
      "walked twenty feet when he had forgotten both his rage and the\n",
      "fisherman and started to think about what he had owned and what he\n",
      "had lost. Nobody knows what he has owned until he has lost it. He\n",
      "began to think about his sheep, which were as white as snow in the\n",

      "who understood him and knew him and esteemed him, and about his\n",
      "cows, which were led out the lanes one evening last spring and\n",
      "strange boys ran after them with bits of strap. And he began to\n",

      "By Rudyard Kipling\n",
      "\n",
      "(_Civil and Military Gazette_, 26 September 1884)\n",
      "\n",
      "In the daytime, when she moved about me,\n",
      "    In the night, when she was sleeping at my side,--\n",
      "I was wearied, I was wearied of her presence,\n",
      "Day by day and night by night I grew to hate her--\n",
      "    Would God that she or I had died!\n",
      "\n",
      "--CONFESSIONS\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a man called Bronckhorst--a three-cornered, middle-aged man in\n",
      "the Army--grey as a badger, and, some people said, with a touch of\n",
      "country-blood in him. That, however, cannot be proved. Mrs. Bronckhorst\n",
      "was not exactly young, though fifteen years younger than her husband.\n",
      "She was a large, pale, quiet woman, with heavy eyelids over weak eyes,\n",
      "and hair that turned red or yellow as the lights fell on it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bronckhorst was not nice in any way. He had no respect for the pretty\n",
      "public and private lies that make life a little less nasty than it is.\n",
      "His manner towards his wife was coarse. There are many things--including\n",
      "actual assault with the clenched fist--that a wife will endure; but\n",
      "seldom a wife can bear--as Mrs. Bronckhorst bore--with a long course of\n",
      "brutal, hard chaff, making light of her weaknesses, her headaches, her\n",
      "small fits of gaiety, her dresses, her queer little attempts to make\n",
      "herself attractive to her husband when she knows that she is not what\n",
      "she has been, and--worst of all--the love that she spends on her\n",
      "children. That particular sort of heavy-handed jest was specially dear\n",
      "to Bronckhorst. I suppose that he had first slipped into it, meaning no\n",
      "harm, in the honeymoon, when folk find their ordinary stock of\n",
      "endearments run short, and so go to the other extreme to express their\n",
      "feelings. A similar impulse makes a man say, '_Hutt_, you old beast!'\n",
      "when a favourite horse nuzzles his coat-front. Unluckily, when the\n",
      "reaction of marriage sets in, the form of speech remains, and, the\n",
      "tenderness having died out, hurts the wife more than she cares to say.\n",
      "But Mrs. Bronckhorst was devoted to her 'Teddy' as she called him.\n",
      "Perhaps that was why he objected to her. Perhaps--this is only a theory\n",
      "to account for his infamous behaviour later on--he gave way to the\n",
      "queer, savage feeling that sometimes takes by the throat a husband\n",
      "twenty years married, when he sees, across the table, the same, same\n",
      "face of his wedded wife, and knows that, as he has sat facing it, so\n",
      "must he continue to sit until the day of its death or his own. Most men\n",
      "and all women know the spasm. It only lasts for three breaths as a rule,\n",
      "must be a 'throw-back' to times when men and women were rather worse\n",
      "than they are now, and is too unpleasant to be discussed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dinner at the Bronckhorsts' was an infliction few men cared to undergo.\n",
      "Bronckhorst took a pleasure in saying things that made his wife wince.\n",
      "When their little boy came in at dessert Bronckhorst used to give him\n",
      "half a glass of wine, and, naturally enough, the poor little mite got\n",
      "first riotous, next miserable, and was removed screaming. Bronckhorst\n",
      "asked if that was the way Teddy usually behaved, and whether Mrs.\n",
      "Bronckhorst could not spare some of her time 'to teach the little beggar\n",
      "decency'. Mrs. Bronckhorst, who loved the boy more than her own life,\n",
      "tried not to cry--her spirit seemed to have been broken by her marriage.\n",
      "Lastly, Bronckhorst used to say, 'There! That'll do, that'll do. For\n",
      "God's sake try to behave like a rational woman. Go into the\n",
      "drawing-room.' Mrs. Bronckhorst would go, trying to carry it all off\n",
      "with a smile; and the guest of the evening would feel angry and\n",
      "uncomfortable.\n",
      "\n",
      "After three years of this cheerful life--for Mrs. Bronckhorst had no\n",
      "women-friends to talk to--the station was startled by the news that\n",
      "Bronckhorst had instituted proceedings _on the criminal count_, against\n",
      "a man called Biel, who certainly had been rather attentive to Mrs.\n",
      "Bronckhorst whenever she had appeared in public. The utter want of\n",
      "reserve with which Bronckhorst treated his own dishonour helped us to\n",
      "know that the evidence against Biel would be entirely circumstantial and\n",
      "native. There were no letters; but Bronckhorst said openly that he would\n",
      "rack Heaven and Earth until he saw Biel superintending the manufacture\n",
      "of carpets in the Central Jail. Mrs. Bronckhorst kept entirely to her\n",
      "house, and let charitable folks say what they pleased. Opinions were\n",
      "divided. Some two-thirds of the station jumped at once to the conclusion\n",
      "that Biel was guilty; but a dozen men who knew and liked him held by\n",
      "him. Biel was furious and surprised. He denied the whole thing, and\n",
      "vowed that he would thrash Bronckhorst within an inch of his life. No\n",
      "jury, we knew, would convict a man on the criminal count on native\n",
      "evidence in a land where you can buy a murder-charge, including the\n",
      "corpse, all complete for fifty-four rupees; but Biel did not care to\n",
      "scrape through by the benefit of a doubt. He wanted the whole thing\n",
      "cleared; but, as he said one night, 'He can prove anything with\n",
      "servants' evidence, and I've only my bare word.' This was almost a month\n",
      "before the case came on; and beyond agreeing with Biel, we could do\n",
      "little. All that we could be sure of was that the native evidence would\n",
      "be bad enough to blast Biel's character for the rest of his service; for\n",
      "when a native begins perjury he perjures himself thoroughly. He does not\n",
      "boggle over details.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some genius at the end of the table whereat the affair was being talked\n",
      "over, said, 'Look here! I don't believe lawyers are any good. Get a man\n",
      "to wire to Strickland, and beg him to come down and pull us through.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Strickland was about a hundred and eighty miles up the line. He had not\n",
      "long been married to Miss Youghal, but he scented in the telegram a\n",
      "chance of return to the old detective work that his soul lusted after,\n",
      "and next time he came in and heard our story. He finished his pipe and\n",
      "said oracularly, 'We must get at the evidence. Oorya bearer, Mussulman\n",
      "_khit_ and sweeper _ayah_, I suppose, are the pillars of the charge. I\n",
      "am on in this piece; but I'm afraid I'm getting rusty in my talk.'\n",
      "\n",
      "He rose and went into Biel's bedroom, where his trunk had been put, and\n",
      "shut the door. An hour later, we heard him say, 'I hadn't the heart to\n",
      "part with my old make-ups when I married. Will this do?' There was a\n",
      "loathly _fakir_ salaaming in the doorway.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Now lend me fifty rupees,' said Strickland, 'and give me your Words of\n",
      "Honour that you won't tell my wife.'\n",
      "\n",
      "He got all that he asked for, and left the house while the table drank\n",
      "his health. What he did only he himself knows. A _fakir_ hung about\n",
      "Bronckhorst's compound for twelve days. Then a sweeper appeared, and\n",
      "when Biel heard of _him_, he said that Strickland was an angel\n",
      "full-fledged. Whether the sweeper made love to Janki, Mrs. Bronckhorst's\n",
      "_ayah_, is a question which concerns Strickland exclusively.\n",
      "\n",
      "He came back at the end of three weeks, and said quietly, 'You spoke the\n",
      "truth, Biel. The whole business is put up from beginning to end. Jove!\n",
      "It almost astonishes _me_! That Bronckhorst beast isn't fit to live.'\n",
      "\n",
      "There was uproar and shouting, and Biel said, 'How are you going to\n",
      "prove it? You can't say that you've been trespassing on Bronckhorst's\n",
      "compound in disguise!'\n",
      "\n",
      "'No,' said Strickland. 'Tell your lawyer-fool, whoever he is, to get up\n",
      "something strong about \"inherent improbabilities\" and \"discrepancies of\n",
      "evidence\". He won't have to speak, but it will make him happy, _I_'m\n",
      "going to run this business.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Biel held his tongue, and the other men waited to see what would happen.\n",
      "They trusted Strickland as men trust quiet men. When the case came off\n",
      "the Court was crowded. Strickland hung about in the veranda of the\n",
      "Court, till he met the Mohammedan _khitmutgar_. Then he murmured a\n",
      "_fakir's_ blessing in his ear, and asked him how his second wife did.\n",
      "The man spun round, and, as he looked into the eyes of 'Estreekin\n",
      "Sahib', his jaw dropped. You must remember that before Strickland was\n",
      "married, he was, as I have told you already, a power among natives.\n",
      "Strickland whispered a rather coarse vernacular proverb to the effect\n",
      "that he was abreast of all that was going on, and went into the Court\n",
      "armed with a gut trainer's-whip.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Mohammedan was the first witness, and Strickland beamed upon him\n",
      "from the back of the Court. The man moistened his lips with his tongue\n",
      "and, in his abject fear of 'Estreekin Sahib', the _fakir_ went back on\n",
      "every detail of his evidence--said he was a poor man, and God was his\n",
      "witness that he had forgotten everything that Bronckhorst Sahib had told\n",
      "him to say. Between his terror of Strickland, the Judge, and Bronckhorst\n",
      "he collapsed weeping.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then began the panic among the witnesses. Janki, the _ayah_, leering\n",
      "chastely behind her veil, turned grey, and the bearer left the Court. He\n",
      "said that his Mamma was dying, and that it was not wholesome for any man\n",
      "to lie unthriftily in the presence of 'Estreekin Sahib'.\n",
      "\n",
      "Biel said politely to Bronckhorst, 'Your witnesses don't seem to work.\n",
      "Haven't you any forged letters to produce?' But Bronckhorst was swaying\n",
      "to and fro in his chair, and there was a dead pause after Biel had been\n",
      "called to order.\n",
      "\n",

      "fifty-two before one can really appreciate the exquisite enjoyment of\n",
      "doing nothing for twelve hours at a stretch. Willoughby had spent the\n",

      "unbearable, he had retreated to an orchard, where, lying on his back in\n",
      "the long cool grass, he had traced the pattern of the apple-leaves\n",
      "diapered above him upon the summer sky; now that the heat of the day was\n",
      "over he had come to roam whither sweet fancy led him, to lean over\n",

      "well-spent day. Five such days had already passed over his head, fifteen\n",
      "more remained to him. Then farewell to freedom and clean country air!\n",
      "Back again to London and another year's toil.\n",
      "\n",
      "He came to a gate on the right of the road. Behind it a footpath\n",
      "meandered up over a grassy slope. The sheep nibbling on its summit cast\n",
      "long shadows down the hill almost to his feet. Road and fieldpath were\n",
      "equally new to him, but the latter offered greener attractions; he\n",

      "Willoughby gained the ridge from which they had just scattered, he came\n",
      "in sight of a woman sitting on a stile at the further end of the field.\n",
      "As he advanced towards her he saw that she was young, and that she was\n",
      "not what is called 'a lady'--of which he was glad: an earlier episode in\n",
      "his career having indissolubly associated in his mind ideas of feminine\n",
      "refinement with those of feminine treachery.\n",
      "\n",
      "He thought it probable this girl would be willing to dispense with the\n",

      "some pleasant foolish chat.\n",
      "\n",
      "As she made no movement to let him pass he stood still, and, looking at\n",
      "her, began to smile.\n",
      "\n",
      "She returned his gaze from unabashed dark eyes, and then laughed,\n",

      "\n",
      "The girl at this laughed again, but nevertheless dropped herself down\n",

      "\n",
      "'And I expect you come from London too?' said Willoughby, recognizing\n",
      "the familiar accent.\n",
      "\n",
      "'You're as sharp as a needle,' cried the girl with her unrestrained\n",
      "laugh; 'so I do. I'm here for a hollerday 'cos I was so done up with the\n",
      "work and the hot weather. I don't look as though I'd bin ill, do I? But\n",
      "I was, though: for it was just stiflin' hot up in our workrooms all\n",

      "\n",
      "Willoughby felt a sudden accession of interest in her. Like many\n",
      "intelligent young men, he had dabbled a little in Socialism, and at one\n",
      "time had wandered among the dispossessed; but since then, had caught up\n",
      "and held loosely the new doctrine--it is a good and fitting thing that\n",
      "woman also should earn her bread by the sweat of her brow. Always in\n",
      "reference to the woman who, fifteen months before, had treated him ill;\n",
      "he had said to himself that even the breaking of stones in the road\n",
      "should be considered a more feminine employment than the breaking of\n",
      "hearts.\n",
      "\n",
      "He gave way therefore to a movement of friendliness for this working\n",
      "daughter of the people, and joined her on the other side of the stile in\n",
      "token of his approval. She, twisting round to face him, leaned now with\n",
      "her back against the bar, and the sunset fires lent a fleeting glory to\n",
      "her face. Perhaps she guessed how becoming the light was, for she took\n",
      "off her hat and let it touch to gold the ends and fringes of her rough\n",
      "abundant hair. Thus and at this moment she made an agreeable picture, to\n",
      "which stood as background all the beautiful, wooded Southshire view.\n",
      "\n",
      "'You don't really mean to say you are a tailoress?' said Willoughby,\n",
      "with a sort of eager compassion.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I do, though! An' I've bin one ever since I was fourteen. Look at my\n",
      "fingers if you don't b'lieve me.'\n",
      "\n",
      "She put out her right hand, and he took hold of it, as he was expected\n",
      "to do. The finger-ends were frayed and blackened by needle-pricks, but\n",
      "the hand itself was plump, moist, and not unshapely. She meanwhile\n",
      "examined Willoughby's fingers enclosing hers.\n",
      "\n",
      "'It's easy ter see you've never done no work!' she said, half admiring,\n",
      "half envious. 'I s'pose you're a tip-top swell, ain't you?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Oh, yes! I'm a tremendous swell indeed!' said Willoughby, ironically.\n",
      "He thought of his hundred and thirty pounds' salary; and he mentioned\n",
      "his position in the British and Colonial Banking house, without shedding\n",
      "much illumination on her mind, for she insisted:\n",
      "\n",
      "'Well, anyhow, you're a gentleman. I've often wished I was a lady. It\n",
      "must be so nice ter wear fine clo'es an' never have ter do any work all\n",
      "day long.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Willoughby thought it innocent of the girl to say this; it reminded him\n",
      "of his own notion as a child--that kings and queens put on their crowns\n",
      "the first thing on rising in the morning. His cordiality rose another\n",
      "degree.\n",
      "\n",
      "'If being a gentleman means having nothing to do,' said he, smiling,\n",
      "'I can certainly lay no claim to the title. Life isn't all beer and\n",
      "skittles with me, any more than it is with you. Which is the better\n",
      "reason for enjoying the present moment, don't you think? Suppose, now,\n",
      "like a kind little girl, you were to show me the way to Beacon Point,\n",
      "which you say is so pretty?'\n",
      "\n",
      "She required no further persuasion. As he walked beside her through the\n",
      "upland fields where the dusk was beginning to fall, and the white\n",
      "evening moths to emerge from their daytime hiding-places, she asked him\n",
      "many personal questions, most of which he thought fit to parry. Taking\n",
      "no offence thereat, she told him, instead, much concerning herself and\n",
      "her family. Thus he learned her name was Esther Stables, that she and\n",
      "her people lived Whitechapel way; that her father was seldom sober, and\n",
      "her mother always ill; and that the aunt with whom she was staying kept\n",
      "the post-office and general shop in Orton village. He learned, too, that\n",
      "Esther was discontented with life in general; that, though she hated\n",
      "being at home, she found the country dreadfully dull; and that,\n",
      "consequently, she was extremely glad to have made his acquaintance. But\n",
      "what he chiefly realized when they parted was that he had spent a couple\n",
      "of pleasant hours talking nonsense with a girl who was natural,\n",
      "simple-minded, and entirely free from that repellently protective\n",
      "atmosphere with which a woman of the 'classes' so carefully surrounds\n",
      "herself. He and Esther had 'made friends' with the ease and rapidity of\n",
      "children before they have learned the dread meaning of 'etiquette', and\n",
      "they said good night, not without some talk of meeting each other again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Obliged to breakfast at a quarter to eight in town, Willoughby was\n",
      "always luxuriously late when in the country, where he took his meals\n",
      "also in leisurely fashion, often reading from a book propped up on the\n",
      "table before him. But the morning after his meeting with Esther Stables\n",
      "found him less disposed to read than usual. Her image obtruded itself\n",
      "upon the printed page, and at length grew so importunate he came to the\n",
      "conclusion the only way to lay it was to confront it with the girl\n",
      "herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wanting some tobacco, he saw a good reason for going into Orton. Esther\n",
      "had told him he could get tobacco and everything else at her aunt's. He\n",
      "found the post-office to be one of the first houses in the widely spaced\n",
      "village street. In front of the cottage was a small garden ablaze with\n",
      "old-fashioned flowers; and in a large garden at one side were\n",
      "apple-trees, raspberry and currant bushes, and six thatched beehives on\n",
      "a bench. The bowed windows of the little shop were partly screened by\n",
      "sunblinds; nevertheless the lower panes still displayed a heterogeneous\n",
      "collection of goods--lemons, hanks of yarn, white linen buttons upon\n",
      "blue cards, sugar cones, churchwarden pipes, and tobacco jars. A\n",
      "letter-box opened its narrow mouth low down in one wall, and over the\n",
      "door swung the sign, 'Stamps and money-order office', in black letters\n",
      "on white enamelled iron.\n",
      "\n",
      "The interior of the shop was cool and dark. A second glass-door at the\n",
      "back permitted Willoughby to see into a small sitting-room, and out\n",
      "again through a low and square-paned window to the sunny landscape\n",
      "beyond. Silhouetted against the light were the heads of two women; the\n",
      "rough young head of yesterday's Esther, the lean outline and bugled cap\n",
      "of Esther's aunt.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was the latter who at the jingling of the doorbell rose from her work\n",
      "and came forward to serve the customer; but the girl, with much mute\n",
      "meaning in her eyes, and a finger laid upon her smiling mouth, followed\n",
      "behind. Her aunt heard her footfall. 'What do you want here, Esther?'\n",
      "she said with thin disapproval; 'get back to your sewing.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Esther gave the young man a signal seen only by him and slipped out into\n",
      "the side-garden, where he found her when his purchases were made. She\n",
      "leaned over the privet-hedge to intercept him as he passed.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Aunt's an awful ole maid,' she remarked apologetically; 'I b'lieve\n",
      "she'd never let me say a word to enny one if she could help it.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'So you got home all right last night?' Willoughby inquired; 'what did\n",
      "your aunt say to you?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Oh, she arst me where I'd been, and I tolder a lotter lies.' Then, with\n",
      "a woman's intuition, perceiving that this speech jarred, Esther made\n",
      "haste to add, 'She's so dreadful hard on me. I dursn't tell her I'd been\n",
      "with a gentleman or she'd never have let me out alone again.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'And at present I suppose you'll be found somewhere about that same\n",
      "stile every evening?' said Willoughby foolishly, for he really did not\n",
      "much care whether he met her again or not. Now he was actually in her\n",
      "company, he was surprised at himself for having given her a whole\n",
      "morning's thought; yet the eagerness of her answer flattered him, too.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Tonight I can't come, worse luck! It's Thursday, and the shops here\n",
      "close of a Thursday at five. I'll havter keep aunt company. But\n",
      "tomorrer? I can be there tomorrer. You'll come, say?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Esther!' cried a vexed voice, and the precise, right-minded aunt\n",
      "emerged through a row of raspberry-bushes; 'whatever are you thinking\n",
      "about, delayin' the gentleman in this fashion?' She was full of rustic\n",
      "and official civility for 'the gentleman', but indignant with her niece.\n",
      "'I don't want none of your London manners down here,' Willoughby heard\n",
      "her say as she marched the girl off.\n",
      "\n",
      "He himself was not sorry to be released from Esther's too friendly eyes,\n",
      "and he spent an agreeable evening over a book, and this time managed to\n",
      "forget her completely.\n",
      "\n",
      "Though he remembered her first thing next morning, it was to smile\n",
      "wisely and determine he would not meet her again. Yet by dinner-time the\n",
      "day seemed long; why, after all, should he not meet her? By tea-time\n",
      "prudence triumphed anew--no, he would not go. Then he drank his tea\n",
      "hastily and set off for the stile.\n",
      "\n",
      "Esther was waiting for him. Expectation had given an additional colour\n",
      "to her cheeks, and her red-brown hair showed here and there a beautiful\n",
      "glint of gold. He could not help admiring the vigorous way in which it\n",
      "waved and twisted, or the little curls which grew at the nape of her\n",
      "neck, tight and close as those of a young lamb's fleece. Her neck here\n",
      "was admirable, too, in its smooth creaminess; and when her eyes lighted\n",
      "up with such evident pleasure at his coming, how avoid the conviction\n",
      "she was a good and nice girl after all?\n",
      "\n",
      "He proposed they should go down into the little copse on the right,\n",
      "where they would be less disturbed by the occasional passer-by. Here,\n",
      "seated on a felled tree-trunk, Willoughby began that bantering, silly,\n",
      "meaningless form of conversation known among the 'classes' as flirting.\n",
      "He had but the wish to make himself agreeable, and to while away the\n",
      "time. Esther, however, misunderstood him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Willoughby's hand lay palm downwards on his knee, and she, noticing a\n",
      "ring which he wore on his little finger, took hold of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "'What a funny ring!' she said; 'let's look?'\n",
      "\n",
      "To disembarrass himself of her touch, he pulled the ring off and gave\n",
      "it her to examine.\n",
      "\n",
      "'What's that ugly dark green stone?' she asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "'It's called a sardonyx.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'What's it for?' she said, turning it about.\n",
      "\n",
      "'It's a signet ring, to seal letters with.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'An' there's a sorter king's head scratched on it, an' some writin' too,\n",
      "only I carnt make it out?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'It isn't the head of a king, although it wears a crown,' Willoughby\n",
      "explained, 'but the head and bust of a Saracen against whom my ancestor\n",
      "of many hundred years ago went to fight in the Holy Land. And the words\n",
      "cut round it are our motto, \"Vertue vauncet\", which means virtue\n",
      "prevails.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Willoughby may have displayed some accession of dignity in giving this\n",
      "bit of family history, for Esther fell into uncontrolled laughter, at\n",
      "which he was much displeased. And when the girl made as though she would\n",
      "put the ring on her own finger, asking, 'Shall I keep it?' he coloured\n",
      "up with sudden annoyance.\n",
      "\n",
      "'It was only my fun!' said Esther hastily, and gave him the ring back,\n",
      "but his cordiality was gone. He felt no inclination to renew the\n",
      "idle-word pastime, said it was time to go, and, swinging his cane\n",
      "vexedly, struck off the heads of the flowers and the weeds as he went.\n",
      "Esther walked by his side in complete silence, a phenomenon of which he\n",
      "presently became conscious. He felt rather ashamed of having shown\n",
      "temper.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Well, here's your way home,' said he with an effort at friendliness.\n",
      "'Goodbye; we've had a nice evening anyhow. It was pleasant down there\n",
      "in the woods, eh?'\n",
      "\n",
      "He was astonished to see her eyes soften with tears, and to hear the\n",
      "real emotion in her voice as she answered, 'It was just heaven down\n",
      "there with you until you turned so funny-like. What had I done to make\n",
      "you cross? Say you forgive me, do!'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Silly child!' said Willoughby, completely mollified, 'I'm not the least\n",
      "angry. There, goodbye!' and like a fool he kissed her.\n",
      "\n",
      "He anathematized his folly in the white light of next morning, and,\n",
      "remembering the kiss he had given her, repented it very sincerely. He\n",
      "had an uncomfortable suspicion she had not received it in the same\n",
      "spirit in which it had been bestowed, but, attaching more serious\n",
      "meaning to it, would build expectations thereon which must be left\n",
      "unfulfilled. It was best indeed not to meet her again; for he\n",
      "acknowledged to himself that, though he only half liked, and even\n",
      "slightly feared her, there was a certain attraction about her--was it in\n",
      "her dark unflinching eyes or in her very red lips?--which might lead him\n",
      "into greater follies still.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus it came about that for two successive evenings Esther waited for\n",
      "him in vain, and on the third evening he said to himself, with a\n",
      "grudging relief, that by this time she had probably transferred her\n",
      "affections to someone else.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was Saturday, the second Saturday since he left town. He spent the\n",
      "day about the farm, contemplated the pigs, inspected the feeding of the\n",
      "stock, and assisted at the afternoon milking. Then at evening, with a\n",
      "refilled pipe, he went for a long lean over the west gate, while he\n",
      "traced fantastic pictures and wove romances in the glories of the sunset\n",

      "\n",
      "He watched the colours glow from gold to scarlet, change to crimson,\n",
      "sink at last to sad purple reefs and isles, when the sudden\n",
      "consciousness of someone being near him made him turn round. There\n",
      "stood Esther, and her eyes were full of eagerness and anger.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Why have you never been to the stile again?' she asked him. 'You\n",
      "promised to come faithful, and you never came. Why have you not kep'\n",
      "your promise? Why? Why?' she persisted, stamping her foot because\n",
      "Willoughby remained silent.\n",
      "\n",
      "What could he say? Tell her she had no business to follow him like this;\n",
      "or own, what was, unfortunately, the truth, he was just a little glad to\n",
      "see her?\n",
      "\n",
      "'Praps you don't care for me any more?' she said. 'Well, why did you\n",
      "kiss me, then?'\n",
      "\n",
      "Why, indeed! thought Willoughby, marvelling at his own idiocy, and\n",
      "yet--such is the inconsistency of man--not wholly without the desire to\n",
      "kiss her again. And while he looked at her she suddenly flung herself\n",
      "down on the hedge-bank at his feet and burst into tears. She did not\n",
      "cover up her face, but simply pressed one cheek down upon the grass\n",
      "while the water poured from her eyes with astonishing abundance.\n",
      "Willoughby saw the dry earth turn dark and moist as it drank the tears\n",
      "in. This, his first experience of Esther's powers of weeping, distressed\n",
      "him horribly; never in his life before had he seen anyone weep like\n",
      "that, he should not have believed such a thing possible; he was alarmed,\n",
      "too, lest she should be noticed from the house. He opened the gate;\n",
      "'Esther!' he begged, 'don't cry. Come out here, like a dear girl, and\n",
      "let us talk sensibly.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Because she stumbled, unable to see her way through wet eyes, he gave\n",
      "her his hand, and they found themselves in a field of corn, walking\n",
      "along the narrow grass-path that skirted it, in the shadow of the\n",
      "hedgerow.\n",
      "\n",
      "'What is there to cry about because you have not seen me for two days?'\n",
      "he began; 'why, Esther, we are only strangers, after all. When we have\n",
      "been at home a week or two we shall scarcely remember each other's\n",
      "names.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Esther sobbed at intervals, but her tears had ceased. 'It's fine for you\n",
      "to talk of home,' she said to this. 'You've got something that is a\n",
      "home, I s'pose? But me! my home's like hell, with nothing but\n",
      "quarrellin' and cursin', and a father who beats us whether sober or\n",
      "drunk. Yes!' she repeated shrewdly, seeing the lively disgust on\n",
      "Willoughby's face, 'he beat me, all ill as I was, jus' before I come\n",
      "away. I could show you the bruises on my arms still. And now to go back\n",
      "there after knowin' you! It'll be worse than ever. I can't endure it,\n",
      "and I won't! I'll put an end to it or myself somehow, I swear!'\n",
      "\n",
      "'But my poor Esther, how can I help it? what can I do?' said Willoughby.\n",
      "He was greatly moved, full of wrath with her father, with all the world\n",
      "which makes women suffer. He had suffered himself at the hands of a\n",
      "woman and severely, but this, instead of hardening his heart, had only\n",
      "rendered it the more supple. And yet he had a vivid perception of the\n",
      "peril in which he stood. An interior voice urged him to break away, to\n",
      "seek safety in flight even at the cost of appearing cruel or ridiculous;\n",
      "so, coming to a point in the field where an elm-hole jutted out across\n",
      "the path, he saw with relief he could now withdraw his hand from the\n",
      "girl's, since they must walk singly to skirt round it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Esther took a step in advance, stopped and suddenly turned to face him;\n",
      "she held out her two hands and her face was very near his own.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Don't you care for me one little bit?' she said wistfully, and surely\n",
      "sudden madness fell upon him. For he kissed her again, he kissed her\n",
      "many times, he took her in his arms, and pushed all thoughts of the\n",
      "consequences far from him.\n",
      "\n",
      "But when, an hour later, he and Esther stood by the last gate on the\n",
      "road to Orton, some of these consequences were already calling loudly to\n",
      "him.\n",
      "\n",
      "'You know I have only £130 a year?' he told her; 'it's no very brilliant\n",
      "prospect for you to marry me on that.'\n",
      "\n",
      "For he had actually offered her marriage, although to the mediocre\n",
      "man such a proceeding must appear incredible, uncalled for. But to\n",
      "Willoughby, overwhelmed with sadness and remorse, it seemed the only\n",
      "atonement possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sudden exultation leaped at Esther's heart.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Oh! I'm used to managing' she told him confidently, and mentally\n",
      "resolved to buy herself, so soon as she was married, a black feather\n",
      "boa, such as she had coveted last winter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Willoughby spent the remaining days of his holiday in thinking out and\n",
      "planning with Esther the details of his return to London and her own,\n",
      "the secrecy to be observed, the necessary legal steps to be taken, and\n",
      "the quiet suburb in which they would set up housekeeping. And, so\n",
      "successfully did he carry out his arrangements, that within five weeks\n",
      "from the day on which he had first met Esther Stables, he and she came\n",
      "out one morning from a church in Highbury, husband and wife. It was a\n",
      "mellow September day, the streets were filled with sunshine, and\n",
      "Willoughby, in reckless high spirits, imagined he saw a reflection of\n",
      "his own gaiety on the indifferent faces of the passersby. There being no\n",
      "one else to perform the office, he congratulated himself very warmly,\n",
      "and Esther's frequent laughter filled in the pauses of the day.\n",
      "\n",
      "       *       *       *       *       *\n",
      "\n",
      "Three months later Willoughby was dining with a friend, and the\n",
      "hour-hand of the clock nearing ten, the host no longer resisted the\n",
      "guest's growing anxiety to be gone. He arose and exchanged with him\n",
      "good wishes and goodbyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Marriage is evidently a most successful institution,' said he,\n",
      "half-jesting, half-sincere; 'you almost make me inclined to go and get\n",
      "married myself. Confess now your thoughts have been at home the whole\n",
      "evening.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Willoughby thus addressed turned red to the roots of his hair, but did\n",
      "not deny it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The other laughed. 'And very commendable they should be,' he continued,\n",
      "'since you are scarcely, so to speak, out of your honeymoon.'\n",
      "\n",
      "With a social smile on his lips, Willoughby calculated a moment before\n",
      "replying, 'I have been married exactly three months and three days.'\n",
      "Then, after a few words respecting their next meeting, the two shook\n",
      "hands and parted--the young host to finish the evening with books and\n",
      "pipe, the young husband to set out on a twenty minutes' walk to his\n",
      "home.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a cold, clear December night following a day of rain. A touch of\n",
      "frost in the air had dried the pavements, and Willoughby's footfall\n",
      "ringing upon the stones re-echoed down the empty suburban street. Above\n",
      "his head was a dark, remote sky thickly powdered with stars, and as he\n",
      "turned westward Alpherat hung for a moment 'comme le point sur un _i_',\n",
      "over the slender spire of St John's. But he was insensible to the worlds\n",
      "about him; he was absorbed in his own thoughts, and these, as his friend\n",
      "had surmised, were entirely with his wife. For Esther's face was always\n",
      "before his eyes, her voice was always in his ears, she filled the\n",
      "universe for him; yet only four months ago he had never seen her, had\n",
      "never heard her name. This was the curious part of it--here in December\n",
      "he found himself the husband of a girl who was completely dependent upon\n",
      "him not only for food, clothes, and lodging, but for her present\n",
      "happiness, her whole future life; and last July he had been scarcely\n",
      "more than a boy himself, with no greater care on his mind than the\n",
      "pleasant difficulty of deciding where he should spend his annual three\n",
      "weeks' holiday.\n",
      "\n",
      "But it is events, not months or years, which age. Willoughby, who\n",
      "was only twenty-six, remembered his youth as a sometime companion\n",
      "irrevocably lost to him; its vague, delightful hopes were now\n",
      "crystallized into definite ties, and its happy irresponsibilities\n",
      "displaced by a sense of care, inseparable perhaps from the most\n",
      "fortunate of marriages.\n",
      "\n",
      "As he reached the street in which he lodged his pace involuntarily\n",
      "slackened. While still some distance off, his eye sought out and\n",
      "distinguished the windows of the room in which Esther awaited him.\n",
      "Through the broken slats of the Venetian blinds he could see the yellow\n",
      "gaslight within. The parlour beneath was in darkness; his landlady had\n",
      "evidently gone to bed, there being no light over the hall-door either.\n",
      "In some apprehension he consulted his watch under the last street-lamp\n",
      "he passed, to find comfort in assuring himself it was only ten minutes\n",
      "after ten. He let himself in with his latch-key, hung up his hat and\n",
      "overcoat by the sense of touch, and, groping his way upstairs, opened\n",
      "the door of the first floor sitting-room.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the table in the centre of the room sat his wife, leaning upon her\n",
      "elbows, her two hands thrust up into her ruffled hair; spread out before\n",
      "her was a crumpled yesterday's newspaper, and so interested was she to\n",
      "all appearance in its contents that she neither spoke nor looked up as\n",
      "Willoughby entered. Around her were the still uncleared tokens of her\n",
      "last meal: tea-slops, bread-crumbs, and an egg-shell crushed to\n",
      "fragments upon a plate, which was one of those trifles that set\n",
      "Willoughby's teeth on edge--whenever his wife ate an egg she persisted\n",
      "in turning the egg-cup upside down upon the tablecloth, and pounding the\n",
      "shell to pieces in her plate with her spoon.\n",
      "\n",
      "The room was repulsive in its disorder. The one lighted burner of the\n",
      "gaselier, turned too high, hissed up into a long tongue of flame. The\n",
      "fire smoked feebly under a newly administered shovelful of 'slack', and\n",
      "a heap of ashes and cinders littered the grate. A pair of walking boots,\n",
      "caked in dry mud, lay on the hearth-rug just where they had been thrown\n",
      "off. On the mantelpiece, amidst a dozen other articles which had no\n",
      "business there, was a bedroom-candlestick; and every single article of\n",
      "furniture stood crookedly out of its place.\n",
      "\n",
      "Willoughby took in the whole intolerable picture, and yet spoke with\n",
      "kindliness. 'Well, Esther! I'm not so late, after all. I hope you did\n",
      "not find the time dull by yourself?' Then he explained the reason of his\n",
      "absence. He had met a friend he had not seen for a couple of years, who\n",
      "had insisted on taking him home to dine.\n",
      "\n",
      "His wife gave no sign of having heard him; she kept her eyes riveted on\n",
      "the paper before her.\n",
      "\n",
      "'You received my wire, of course,' Willoughby went on, 'and did not\n",
      "wait?'\n",
      "\n",
      "Now she crushed the newspaper up with a passionate movement, and threw\n",
      "it from her. She raised her head, showing cheeks blazing with anger, and\n",
      "dark, sullen, unflinching eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I did wyte then!' she cried 'I wyted till near eight before I got\n",
      "your old telegraph! I s'pose that's what you call the manners of a\n",
      "\"gentleman\", to keep your wife mewed up here, while you go gallivantin'\n",
      "off with your fine friends?'\n",
      "\n",
      "Whenever Esther was angry, which was often, she taunted Willoughby with\n",
      "being 'a gentleman', although this was the precise point about him which\n",
      "at other times found most favour in her eyes. But tonight she was\n",
      "envenomed by the idea he had been enjoying himself without her, stung\n",
      "by fear lest he should have been in company with some other woman.\n",
      "\n",
      "Willoughby, hearing the taunt, resigned himself to the inevitable.\n",
      "Nothing that he could do might now avert the breaking storm; all his\n",
      "words would only be twisted into fresh griefs. But sad experience had\n",
      "taught him that to take refuge in silence was more fatal still. When\n",
      "Esther was in such a mood as this it was best to supply the fire with\n",
      "fuel, that, through the very violence of the conflagration, it might\n",
      "the sooner burn itself out.\n",
      "\n",
      "So he said what soothing things he could, and Esther caught them up,\n",
      "disfigured them, and flung them back at him with scorn. She reproached\n",
      "him with no longer caring for her; she vituperated the conduct of his\n",
      "family in never taking the smallest notice of her marriage; and she\n",
      "detailed the insolence of the landlady who had told her that morning she\n",
      "pitied 'poor Mr. Willoughby', and had refused to go out and buy herrings\n",
      "for Esther's early dinner.\n",
      "\n",
      "Every affront or grievance, real or imaginary, since the day she and\n",
      "Willoughby had first met, she poured forth with a fluency due to\n",
      "frequent repetition, for, with the exception of today's added injuries,\n",
      "Willoughby had heard the whole litany many times before.\n",
      "\n",
      "While she raged and he looked at her, he remembered he had once thought\n",
      "her pretty. He had seen beauty in her rough brown hair, her strong\n",
      "colouring, her full red mouth. He fell into musing ... a woman may lack\n",
      "beauty, he told himself, and yet be loved....\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile Esther reached white heats of passion, and the strain could no\n",
      "longer be sustained. She broke into sobs and began to shed tears with\n",
      "the facility peculiar to her. In a moment her face was all wet with the\n",
      "big drops which rolled down her cheeks faster and faster, and fell with\n",
      "audible splashes on to the table, on to her lap, on to the floor. To\n",
      "this tearful abundance, formerly a surprising spectacle, Willoughby\n",
      "was now acclimatized; but the remnant of chivalrous feeling not yet\n",
      "extinguished in his bosom forbade him to sit stolidly by while a woman\n",
      "wept, without seeking to console her. As on previous occasions, his\n",
      "peace-overtures were eventually accepted. Esther's tears gradually\n",
      "ceased to flow, she began to exhibit a sort of compunction, she wished\n",
      "to be forgiven, and, with the kiss of reconciliation, passed into a\n",
      "phase of demonstrative affection perhaps more trying to Willoughby's\n",
      "patience than all that had preceded it. 'You don't love me?' she\n",
      "questioned, 'I'm sure you don't love me?' she reiterated; and he\n",
      "asseverated that he loved her until he despised himself. Then at last,\n",
      "only half satisfied, but wearied out with vexation--possibly, too, with\n",
      "a movement of pity at the sight of his haggard face--she consented to\n",
      "leave him. Only, what was he going to do? she asked suspiciously; write\n",
      "those rubbishing stories of his? Well, he must promise not to stay up\n",
      "more than half-an-hour at the latest--only until he had smoked one pipe.\n",
      "\n",
      "Willoughby promised, as he would have promised anything on earth to\n",
      "secure to himself a half-hour's peace and solitude. Esther groped for\n",
      "her slippers, which were kicked off under the table; scratched four or\n",
      "five matches along the box and threw them away before she succeeded in\n",
      "lighting her candle; set it down again to contemplate her tear-swollen\n",
      "reflection in the chimney-glass, and burst out laughing.\n",
      "\n",
      "'What a fright I do look, to be sure!' she remarked complacently, and\n",
      "again thrust her two hands up through her disordered curls. Then,\n",
      "holding the candle at such an angle that the grease ran over on to the\n",
      "carpet, she gave Willoughby another vehement kiss and trailed out of the\n",
      "room with an ineffectual attempt to close the door behind her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Willoughby got up to shut it himself, and wondered why it was that\n",
      "Esther never did any one mortal thing efficiently or well. Good God! how\n",
      "irritable he felt. It was impossible to write. He must find an outlet\n",
      "for his impatience, rend or mend something. He began to straighten the\n",
      "room, but a wave of disgust came over him before the task was fairly\n",
      "commenced. What was the use? Tomorrow all would be bad as before. What\n",
      "was the use of doing anything? He sat down by the table and leaned his\n",
      "head upon his hands.\n",
      "\n",
      "       *       *       *       *       *\n",
      "\n",
      "The past came back to him in pictures: his boyhood's past first of all.\n",
      "He saw again the old home, every inch of which was familiar to him as\n",
      "his own name; he reconstructed in his thought all the old well-known\n",
      "furniture, and replaced it precisely as it had stood long ago. He passed\n",
      "again a childish finger over the rough surface of the faded Utrecht\n",
      "velvet chairs, and smelled again the strong fragrance of the white lilac\n",
      "tree, blowing in through the open parlour-window. He savoured anew the\n",
      "pleasant mental atmosphere produced by the dainty neatness of cultured\n",
      "women, the companionship of a few good pictures, of a few good books.\n",
      "Yet this home had been broken up years ago, the dear familiar things had\n",
      "been scattered far and wide, never to find themselves under the same\n",
      "roof again; and from those near relatives who still remained to him he\n",
      "lived now hopelessly estranged.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then came the past of his first love-dream, when he worshipped at the\n",
      "feet of Nora Beresford, and, with the whole-heartedness of the true\n",
      "fanatic, clothed his idol with every imaginable attribute of virtue and\n",
      "tenderness. To this day there remained a secret shrine in his heart\n",
      "wherein the Lady of his young ideal was still enthroned, although it was\n",
      "long since he had come to perceive she had nothing whatever in common\n",
      "with the Nora of reality. For the real Nora he had no longer any\n",
      "sentiment, she had passed altogether out of his life and thoughts; and\n",
      "yet, so permanent is all influence, whether good or evil, that the\n",
      "effect she wrought upon his character remained. He recognized tonight\n",
      "that her treatment of him in the past did not count for nothing among\n",
      "the various factors which had determined his fate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, the past of only last year returned, and, strangely enough, this\n",
      "seemed farther removed from him than all the rest. He had been\n",
      "particularly strong, well, and happy this time last year. Nora was\n",
      "dismissed from his mind, and he had thrown all his energies into his\n",
      "work. His tastes were sane and simple, and his dingy, furnished rooms\n",
      "had become through habit very pleasant to him. In being his own, they\n",
      "were invested with a greater charm than another man's castle. Here he\n",
      "had smoked and studied, here he had made many a glorious voyage into the\n",
      "land of books. Many a homecoming, too, rose up before him out of the\n",
      "dark ungenial streets, to a clear blazing fire, a neatly laid cloth, an\n",
      "evening of ideal enjoyment; many a summer twilight when he mused at the\n",
      "open window, plunging his gaze deep into the recesses of his neighbour's\n",
      "lime-tree, where the unseen sparrows chattered with such unflagging\n",
      "gaiety.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had always been given to much daydreaming, and it was in the silence\n",
      "of his rooms of an evening that he turned his phantasmal adventures into\n",
      "stories for the magazines; here had come to him many an editorial\n",
      "refusal, but here, too, he had received the news of his first unexpected\n",
      "success. All his happiest memories were embalmed in those shabby,\n",
      "badly-furnished rooms.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now all was changed. Now might there be no longer any soft indulgence\n",
      "of the hour's mood. His rooms and everything he owned belonged now to\n",
      "Esther, too. She had objected to most of his photographs, and had\n",
      "removed them. She hated books, and were he ever so ill-advised as to\n",
      "open one in her presence, she immediately began to talk, no matter how\n",
      "silent or how sullen her previous mood had been. If he read aloud to her\n",
      "she either yawned despairingly, or was tickled into laughter where there\n",
      "was no reasonable cause. At first Willoughby had tried to educate her,\n",
      "and had gone hopefully to the task. It is so natural to think you may\n",
      "make what you will of the woman who loves you. But Esther had no wish to\n",
      "improve. She evinced all the self-satisfaction of an illiterate mind. To\n",
      "her husband's gentle admonitions she replied with brevity that she\n",
      "thought her way quite as good as his; or, if he didn't approve of her\n",
      "pronunciation, he might do the other thing, she was too old to go to\n",
      "school again. He gave up the attempt, and, with humiliation at his\n",
      "previous fatuity, perceived that it was folly to expect that a few weeks\n",
      "of his companionship could alter or pull up the impressions of years, or\n",
      "rather of generations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet here he paused to admit a curious thing: it was not only Esther's\n",
      "bad habits which vexed him, but habits quite unblameworthy in themselves\n",
      "which he never would have noticed in another, irritated him in her. He\n",
      "disliked her manner of standing, of walking, of sitting in a chair, of\n",
      "folding her hands. Like a lover, he was conscious of her proximity\n",
      "without seeing her. Like a lover, too, his eyes followed her every\n",
      "movement, his ear noted every change in her voice. But then, instead of\n",
      "being charmed by everything as the lover is, everything jarred upon him.\n",
      "\n",
      "What was the meaning of this? Tonight the anomaly pressed upon him: he\n",
      "reviewed his position. Here was he, quite a young man, just twenty-six\n",
      "years of age, married to Esther, and bound to live with her so long as\n",
      "life should last--twenty, forty, perhaps fifty years more. Every day of\n",
      "those years to be spent in her society; he and she face to face, soul to\n",
      "soul; they two alone amid all the whirling, busy, indifferent world. So\n",
      "near together in semblance; in truth, so far apart as regards all that\n",
      "makes life dear.\n",
      "\n",
      "Willoughby groaned. From the woman he did not love, whom he had never\n",
      "loved, he might not again go free; so much he recognized. The feeling he\n",
      "had once entertained for Esther, strange compound of mistaken chivalry\n",
      "and flattered vanity, was long since extinct; but what, then, was the\n",
      "sentiment with which she inspired him? For he was not indifferent to\n",
      "her--no, never for one instant could he persuade himself he was\n",
      "indifferent, never for one instant could he banish her from his\n",
      "thoughts. His mind's eye followed her during his hours of absence as\n",
      "pertinaciously as his bodily eye dwelt upon her actual presence. She was\n",
      "the principal object of the universe to him, the centre around which his\n",
      "wheel of life revolved with an appalling fidelity.\n",
      "\n",
      "What did it mean? What could it mean? he asked himself with anguish.\n",
      "\n",
      "And the sweat broke out upon his forehead and his hands grew cold, for\n",
      "on a sudden the truth lay there like a written word upon the tablecloth\n",
      "before him. This woman, whom he had taken to himself for better, for\n",
      "worse, inspired him with a passion, intense indeed, all-masterful,\n",
      "soul-subduing as Love itself.... But when he understood the terror of\n",
      "his Hatred, he laid his head upon his arms and wept, not facile tears\n",
      "like Esther's, but tears wrung out from his agonizing, unavailing\n",
      "regret.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Jennings (or Jinnins, as the neighbours would have it) ruled\n",
      "absolutely at home, when she took so much trouble as to do anything at\n",
      "all there--which was less often than might have been. As for Robert her\n",
      "husband, he was a poor stick, said the neighbours. And yet he was a man\n",
      "with enough of hardihood to remain a non-unionist in the erectors' shop\n",
      "at Maidment's all the years of his service; no mean test of a man's\n",
      "fortitude and resolution, as many a sufferer for independent opinion\n",
      "might testify. The truth was that Bob never grew out of his\n",
      "courtship-blindness. Mrs. Jennings governed as she pleased, stayed out\n",
      "or came home as she chose, and cooked a dinner or didn't, as her\n",
      "inclination stood. Thus it was for ten years, during which time there\n",
      "were no children, and Bob bore all things uncomplaining: cooking his own\n",
      "dinner when he found none cooked, and sewing on his own buttons. Then of\n",
      "a sudden came children, till in three years there were three; and Bob\n",
      "Jennings had to nurse and to wash them as often as not.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Jennings at this time was what is called rather a fine woman: a\n",
      "woman of large scale and full development; whose slatternly habit left\n",
      "her coarse black hair to tumble in snake-locks about her face and\n",
      "shoulders half the day; who, clad in half-hooked clothes, bore herself\n",
      "notoriously and unabashed in her fullness; and of whom ill things were\n",
      "said regarding the lodger. The gossips had their excuse. The lodger was\n",
      "an irregular young cabinet-maker, who lost quarters and halves and whole\n",
      "days; who had been seen abroad with his landlady, what time Bob Jennings\n",
      "was putting the children to bed at home; who on his frequent holidays\n",
      "brought in much beer, which he and the woman shared, while Bob was at\n",
      "work. To carry the tale to Bob would have been a thankless errand, for\n",
      "he would have none of anybody's sympathy, even in regard to miseries\n",
      "plain to his eye. But the thing got about in the workshop, and there\n",
      "his days were made bitter.\n",
      "\n",
      "At home things grew worse. To return at half-past five, and find the\n",
      "children still undressed, screaming, hungry and dirty, was a matter of\n",
      "habit: to get them food, to wash them, to tend the cuts and bumps\n",
      "sustained through the day of neglect, before lighting a fire and getting\n",
      "tea for himself, were matters of daily duty. 'Ah,' he said to his\n",
      "sister, who came at intervals to say plain things about Mrs. Jennings,\n",
      "'you shouldn't go for to set a man agin 'is wife, Jin. Melier do'n' like\n",
      "work, I know, but that's nach'ral to 'er. She ought to married a swell\n",
      "'stead o' me; she might 'a' done easy if she liked, bein' sich a fine\n",
      "gal; but she's good-'arted, is Melier; an' she can't 'elp bein' a bit\n",
      "thoughtless.' Whereat his sister called him a fool (it was her customary\n",
      "goodbye at such times), and took herself off.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bob Jennings's intelligence was sufficient for his common needs, but it\n",
      "was never a vast intelligence. Now, under a daily burden of dull misery,\n",
      "it clouded and stooped. The base wit of the workshop he comprehended\n",
      "less, and realized more slowly, than before; and the gaffer cursed him\n",
      "for a sleepy dolt.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Jennings ceased from any pretence of housewifery, and would\n",
      "sometimes sit--perchance not quite sober--while Bob washed the children\n",
      "in the evening, opening her mouth only to express her contempt for him\n",
      "and his establishment, and to make him understand that she was sick of\n",
      "both. Once, exasperated by his quietness, she struck at him, and for a\n",
      "moment he was another man. 'Don't do that, Melier,' he said, 'else I\n",
      "might forget myself.' His manner surprised his wife: and it was such\n",
      "that she never did do that again.\n",
      "\n",
      "So was Bob Jennings: without a friend in the world, except his sister,\n",
      "who chid him, and the children, who squalled at him: when his wife\n",
      "vanished with the lodger, the clock, a shade of wax flowers, Bob's best\n",
      "boots (which fitted the lodger), and his silver watch. Bob had returned,\n",
      "as usual, to the dirt and the children, and it was only when he struck a\n",
      "light that he found the clock was gone.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Mummy tooked ve t'ock,' said Milly, the eldest child, who had followed\n",
      "him in from the door, and now gravely observed his movements. 'She\n",
      "tooked ve t'ock an' went ta-ta. An' she tooked ve fyowers.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Bob lit the paraffin lamp with the green glass reservoir, and carried\n",
      "it and its evil smell about the house. Some things had been turned over\n",
      "and others had gone, plainly. All Melier's clothes were gone. The lodger\n",
      "was not in, and under his bedroom window, where his box had stood, there\n",
      "was naught but an oblong patch of conspicuously clean wallpaper. In a\n",
      "muddle of doubt and perplexity, Bob found himself at the front door,\n",
      "staring up and down the street. Divers women-neighbours stood at their\n",
      "doors, and eyed him curiously; for Mrs. Webster, moralist, opposite, had\n",
      "not watched the day's proceedings (nor those of many other days) for\n",
      "nothing, nor had she kept her story to herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "He turned back into the house, a vague notion of what had befallen\n",
      "percolating feebly through his bewilderment. 'I dunno--I dunno,' he\n",
      "faltered, rubbing his ear. His mouth was dry, and he moved his lips\n",
      "uneasily, as he gazed with aimless looks about the walls and ceiling.\n",
      "Presently his eyes rested on the child, and 'Milly,' he said decisively,\n",
      "'come an 'ave yer face washed.'\n",
      "\n",
      "He put the children to bed early, and went out. In the morning, when his\n",
      "sister came, because she had heard the news in common with everybody\n",
      "else, he had not returned. Bob Jennings had never lost more than two\n",
      "quarters in his life, but he was not seen at the workshop all this day.\n",
      "His sister stayed in the house, and in the evening, at his regular\n",
      "homing-time, he appeared, haggard and dusty, and began his preparations\n",
      "for washing the children. When he was made to understand that they had\n",
      "been already attended to, he looked doubtful and troubled for a moment.\n",
      "Presently he said: 'I ain't found 'er yet, Jin; I was in 'opes she might\n",
      "'a' bin back by this. I--I don't expect she'll be very long. She was\n",
      "alwis a bit larky, was Melier; but very good-'arted.'\n",
      "\n",
      "His sister had prepared a strenuous lecture on the theme of 'I told you\n",
      "so'; but the man was so broken, so meek, and so plainly unhinged in his\n",
      "faculties, that she suppressed it. Instead, she gave him comfortable\n",
      "talk, and made him promise in the end to sleep that night, and take up\n",
      "his customary work in the morning.\n",
      "\n",
      "He did these things, and could have worked placidly enough had he but\n",
      "been alone; but the tale had reached the workshop, and there was no lack\n",
      "of brutish chaff to disorder him. This the decenter men would have no\n",
      "part in, and even protested against. But the ill-conditioned kept their\n",
      "way, till, at the cry of 'Bell O!' when all were starting for dinner,\n",
      "one of the worst shouted the cruellest gibe of all. Bob Jennings turned\n",
      "on him and knocked him over a scrap-heap.\n",
      "\n",
      "A shout went up from the hurrying workmen, with a chorus of 'Serve ye\n",
      "right,' and the fallen joker found himself awkwardly confronted by the\n",
      "shop bruiser. But Bob had turned to a corner, and buried his eyes in the\n",
      "bend of his arm, while his shoulders heaved and shook.\n",
      "\n",
      "He slunk away home, and stayed there: walking restlessly to and fro, and\n",
      "often peeping down the street from the window. When, at twilight, his\n",
      "sister came again, he had become almost cheerful, and said with some\n",
      "briskness: 'I'm agoin' to meet 'er, Jin, at seven. I know where she'll\n",
      "be waitin'.'\n",
      "\n",
      "He went upstairs, and after a little while came down again in his best\n",
      "black coat, carefully smoothing a tall hat of obsolete shape with his\n",
      "pocket-handkerchief. 'I ain't wore it for years,' he said. 'I ought to\n",
      "'a' wore it--it might 'a' pleased 'er. She used to say she wouldn't walk\n",
      "with me in no other--when I used to meet 'er in the evenin', at seven\n",
      "o'clock.' He brushed assiduously, and put the hat on. 'I'd better 'ave\n",
      "a shave round the corner as I go along,' he added, fingering his stubbly\n",
      "chin.\n",
      "\n",
      "He received as one not comprehending his sister's persuasion to remain\n",
      "at home; but when he went she followed at a little distance. After his\n",
      "penny shave he made for the main road, where company-keeping couples\n",
      "walked up and down all evening. He stopped at a church, and began pacing\n",
      "slowly to and fro before it, eagerly looking out each way as he went.\n",
      "\n",
      "His sister watched him for nearly half an hour, and then went home. In\n",
      "two hours more she came back with her husband. Bob was still there,\n",
      "walking to and fro.\n",
      "\n",
      "''Ullo, Bob,' said his brother-in-law; 'come along 'ome an' get to bed,\n",
      "there's a good chap. You'll be awright in the mornin'.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'She ain't turned up,' Bob complained, 'or else I've missed 'er. This\n",
      "is the reg'lar place--where I alwis used to meet 'er. But she'll come\n",
      "tomorrer. She used to leave me in the lurch sometimes, bein' nach'rally\n",
      "larky. But very good-'arted, mindjer; very good-'arted.'\n",
      "\n",
      "She did not come the next evening, nor the next, nor the evening after,\n",
      "nor the one after that. But Bob Jennings, howbeit depressed and anxious,\n",
      "was always confident. 'Somethink's prevented 'er tonight,' he would say,\n",
      "'but she'll come tomorrer.... I'll buy a blue tie tomorrer--she used to\n",
      "like me in a blue tie. I won't miss 'er tomorrer. I'll come a little\n",
      "earlier.'\n",
      "\n",
      "So it went. The black coat grew ragged in the service, and hobbledehoys,\n",
      "finding him safe sport, smashed the tall hat over his eyes time after\n",
      "time. He wept over the hat, and straightened it as best he might. Was\n",
      "she coming? Night after night, and night and night. But tomorrow....\n",

      "the opalescent London reek. Holmes nestled in silence into his heavy\n",

      "our places in the Kentish train that we were sufficiently thawed, he to\n",

      "has been entirely justified,' said Holmes. 'I fancy that every one of\n",
      "his cases has found its way into your collection, and I must admit,\n",
      "Watson, that you have some power of selection, which atones for much\n",
      "which I deplore in your narratives. Your fatal habit of looking at\n",
      "everything from the point of view of a story instead of as a scientific\n",

      "the body is left for our inspection. A mere suicide would not have\n",
      "caused him to send for me. As to the release of the lady, it would\n",

      "a fair night's work. Well, here we are at Chislehurst Station, and we\n",

      "\n",
      "A drive of a couple of miles through narrow country lanes brought us\n",

      "through a noble park, between lines of ancient elms, and ended in a\n",
      "low, widespread house, pillared in front after the fashion of Palladio.\n",
      "The central part was evidently of a great age and shrouded in ivy, but\n",
      "the large windows showed that modern changes had been carried out, and\n",

      "stood out on one of the white, round limbs. She hastily covered it.\n",
      "\n",
      "'It is nothing. It has no connection with this hideous business tonight.\n",
      "If you and your friend will sit down, I will tell you all I can.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I am the wife of Sir Eustace Brackenstall. I have been married about\n",
      "a year. I suppose that it is no use my attempting to conceal that our\n",
      "marriage has not been a happy one. I fear that all our neighbours would\n",
      "tell you that, even if I were to attempt to deny it. Perhaps the fault\n",
      "may be partly mine. I was brought up in the freer, less conventional\n",
      "atmosphere of South Australia, and this English life, with its\n",
      "proprieties and its primness, is not congenial to me. But the main\n",
      "reason lies in the one fact, which is notorious to everyone, and that is\n",
      "that Sir Eustace was a confirmed drunkard. To be with such a man for an\n",
      "hour is unpleasant. Can you imagine what it means for a sensitive and\n",
      "high-spirited woman to be tied to him for day and night? It is a\n",
      "sacrilege, a crime, a villany to hold that such a marriage is binding.\n",
      "I say that these monstrous laws of yours will bring a curse upon the\n",
      "land--God will not let such wickedness endure.' For an instant she sat\n",
      "up, her cheeks flushed, and her eyes blazing from under the terrible\n",
      "mark upon her brow. Then the strong, soothing hand of the austere maid\n",
      "drew her head down on to the cushion, and the wild anger died away into\n",
      "passionate sobbing. At last she continued:\n",
      "\n",
      "'I will tell you about last night. You are aware, perhaps, that in this\n",
      "house all the servants sleep in the modern wing. This central block is\n",
      "made up of the dwelling-rooms, with the kitchen behind and our bedroom\n",
      "above. My maid, Theresa, sleeps above my room. There is no one else,\n",
      "and no sound could alarm those who are in the farther wing. This must\n",
      "have been well known to the robbers, or they would not have acted as\n",
      "they did.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Sir Eustace retired about half-past ten. The servants had already gone\n",
      "to their quarters. Only my maid was up, and she had remained in her room\n",
      "at the top of the house until I needed her services. I sat until after\n",
      "eleven in this room, absorbed in a book. Then I walked round to see that\n",
      "all was right before I went upstairs. It was my custom to do this\n",
      "myself, for, as I have explained, Sir Eustace was not always to be\n",
      "trusted. I went into the kitchen, the butler's pantry, the gun-room, the\n",
      "billiard-room, the drawing-room, and finally the dining-room. As I\n",
      "approached the window, which is covered with thick curtains, I suddenly\n",
      "felt the wind blow upon my face and realized that it was open. I flung\n",
      "the curtain aside and found myself face to face with a broad shouldered\n",
      "elderly man, who had just stepped into the room. The window is a long\n",
      "French one, which really forms a door leading to the lawn. I held my\n",
      "bedroom candle lit in my hand, and, by its light, behind the first man I\n",
      "saw two others, who were in the act of entering. I stepped back, but the\n",
      "fellow was on me in an instant. He caught me first by the wrist and then\n",
      "by the throat. I opened my mouth to scream, but he struck me a savage\n",
      "blow with his fist over the eye, and felled me to the ground. I must\n",
      "have been unconscious for a few minutes, for when I came to myself, I\n",
      "found that they had torn down the bell-rope, and had secured me tightly\n",
      "to the oaken chair which stands at the head of the dining-table. I was\n",
      "so firmly bound that I could not move, and a handkerchief round my mouth\n",
      "prevented me from uttering a sound. It was at this instant that my\n",
      "unfortunate husband entered the room. He had evidently heard some\n",
      "suspicious sounds, and he came prepared for such a scene as he found. He\n",
      "was dressed in nightshirt and trousers, with his favourite blackthorn\n",
      "cudgel in his hand. He rushed at the burglars, but another--it was an\n",
      "elderly man--stooped, picked the poker out of the grate and struck him a\n",
      "horrible blow as he passed. He fell with a groan and never moved again.\n",
      "I fainted once more, but again it could only have been for a very few\n",
      "minutes during which I was insensible. When I opened my eyes I found\n",
      "that they had collected the silver from the sideboard, and they had\n",
      "drawn a bottle of wine which stood there. Each of them had a glass in\n",
      "his hand. I have already told you, have I not, that one was elderly,\n",
      "with a beard, and the others young, hairless lads. They might have been\n",
      "a father and his two sons. They talked together in whispers. Then they\n",
      "came over and made sure that I was securely bound. Finally they\n",
      "withdrew, closing the window after them. It was quite a quarter of an\n",
      "hour before I got my mouth free. When I did so, my screams brought the\n",
      "maid to my assistance. The other servants were soon alarmed, and we sent\n",
      "for the local police, who instantly communicated with London. That is\n",
      "really all that I can tell you, gentlemen, and I trust that it will not\n",
      "be necessary for me to go over so painful a story again.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Any questions, Mr. Holmes?' asked Hopkins.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I will not impose any further tax upon Lady Brackenstall's patience and\n",
      "time,' said Holmes. 'Before I go into the dining-room, I should like to\n",
      "hear your experience.' He looked at the maid.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I saw the men before ever they came into the house,' said she. 'As I\n",
      "sat by my bedroom window I saw three men in the moonlight down by the\n",
      "lodge gate yonder, but I thought nothing of it at the time. It was more\n",
      "than an hour after that I heard my mistress scream, and down I ran, to\n",
      "find her, poor lamb, just as she says, and him on the floor, with his\n",
      "blood and brains over the room. It was enough to drive a woman out of\n",
      "her wits, tied there, and her very dress spotted with him, but she never\n",
      "wanted courage, did Miss Mary Fraser of Adelaide and Lady Brackenstall\n",
      "of Abbey Grange hasn't learned new ways. You've questioned her long\n",
      "enough, you gentlemen, and now she is coming to her own room, just with\n",
      "her old Theresa, to get the rest that she badly needs.'\n",
      "\n",
      "With a motherly tenderness the gaunt woman put her arm round her\n",
      "mistress and led her from the room.\n",
      "\n",
      "'She had been with her all her life,' said Hopkins. 'Nursed her as\n",
      "a baby, and came with her to England when they first left Australia,\n",
      "eighteen months ago. Theresa Wright is her name, and the kind of maid\n",
      "you don't pick up nowadays. This way, Mr. Holmes, if you please!'\n",
      "\n",
      "The keen interest had passed out of Holmes's expressive face, and I knew\n",
      "that with the mystery all the charm of the case had departed. There\n",
      "still remained an arrest to be effected, but what were these commonplace\n",
      "rogues that he should soil his hands with them? An abstruse and learned\n",
      "specialist who finds that he has been called in for a case of measles\n",
      "would experience something of the annoyance which I read in my friend's\n",
      "eyes. Yet the scene in the dining-room of the Abbey Grange was\n",
      "sufficiently strange to arrest his attention and to recall his waning\n",
      "interest.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a very large and high chamber, with carved oak ceiling, oaken\n",
      "panelling, and a fine array of deer's heads and ancient weapons around\n",
      "the walls. At the further end from the door was the high French window\n",
      "of which we had heard. Three smaller windows on the right-hand side\n",
      "filled the apartment with cold winter sunshine. On the left was a large,\n",
      "deep fireplace, with a massive, overhanging oak mantelpiece. Beside the\n",
      "fireplace was a heavy oaken chair with arms and crossbars at the bottom.\n",
      "In and out through the open woodwork was woven a crimson cord, which was\n",
      "secured at each side to the crosspiece below. In releasing the lady, the\n",
      "cord had been slipped off her, but the knots with which it had been\n",
      "secured still remained. These details only struck our attention\n",
      "afterwards, for our thoughts were entirely absorbed by the terrible\n",
      "object which lay upon the tiger-skin heathrug in front of the fire.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was the body of a tall, well-made man, about forty years of age. He\n",
      "lay upon his back, his face upturned, with his white teeth grinning\n",
      "through his short, black beard. His two clenched hands were raised above\n",
      "his head, and a heavy, blackthorn stick lay across them. His dark,\n",
      "handsome, aquiline features were convulsed into a spasm of vindictive\n",
      "hatred, which had set his dead face in a terribly fiendish expression.\n",
      "He had evidently been in his bed when the alarm had broken out, for he\n",
      "wore a foppish, embroidered nightshirt, and his bare feet projected from\n",
      "his trousers. His head was horribly injured, and the whole room bore\n",
      "witness to the savage ferocity of the blow which had struck him down.\n",
      "Beside him lay the heavy poker, bent into a curve by the concussion.\n",
      "Holmes examined both it and the indescribable wreck which it had\n",
      "wrought.\n",
      "\n",
      "'He must be a powerful man, this elder Randall,' he remarked.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Yes,' said Hopkins. 'I have some record of the fellow, and he is a\n",
      "rough customer.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'You should have no difficulty in getting him.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Not the slightest. We have been on the look-out for him, and there was\n",
      "some idea that he had got away to America. Now that we know that the\n",
      "gang are here, I don't see how they can escape. We have the news at\n",
      "every seaport already, and a reward will be offered before evening. What\n",
      "beats me is how they could have done so mad a thing, knowing that the\n",
      "lady could describe them and that we could not fail to recognize the\n",
      "description.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Exactly. One would have expected that they would silence Lady\n",
      "Brackenstall as well.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'They may not have realized,' I suggested, 'that she had recovered from\n",
      "her faint.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'That is likely enough. If she seemed to be senseless, they would not\n",
      "take her life. What about this poor fellow, Hopkins? I seem to have\n",
      "heard some queer stories about him.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'He was a good-hearted man when he was sober, but a perfect fiend when\n",
      "he was drunk, or rather when he was half drunk, for he seldom really\n",
      "went the whole way. The devil seemed to be in him at such times, and he\n",
      "was capable of anything. From what I hear, in spite of all his wealth\n",
      "and his title, he very nearly came our way once or twice. There was a\n",
      "scandal about his drenching a dog with petroleum and setting it on\n",
      "fire--her ladyship's dog, to make the matter worse--and that was only\n",
      "hushed up with difficulty. Then he threw a decanter at that maid,\n",
      "Theresa Wright--there was trouble about that. On the whole, and between\n",
      "ourselves, it will be a brighter house without him. What are you looking\n",
      "at now?'\n",
      "\n",
      "Holmes was down on his knees, examining with great attention the knots\n",
      "upon the red cord with which the lady had been secured. Then he\n",
      "carefully scrutinized the broken and frayed end where it had snapped\n",
      "off when the burglar had dragged it down.\n",
      "\n",
      "'When this was pulled down, the bell in the kitchen must have rung\n",
      "loudly,' he remarked.\n",
      "\n",
      "'No one could hear it. The kitchen stands right at the back of the\n",
      "house.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'How did the burglar know no one would hear it? How dared he pull at a\n",
      "bell-rope in that reckless fashion?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Exactly, Mr. Holmes, exactly. You put the very question which I have\n",
      "asked myself again and again. There can be no doubt that this fellow\n",
      "must have known the house and its habits. He must have perfectly\n",
      "understood that the servants would all be in bed at that comparatively\n",
      "early hour, and that no one could possibly hear a bell ring in the\n",
      "kitchen. Therefore, he must have been in close league with one of the\n",
      "servants. Surely that is evident. But there are eight servants, and all\n",
      "of good character.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Other things being equal,' said Holmes, 'one would suspect the one\n",
      "at whose head the master threw a decanter. And yet that would involve\n",
      "treachery towards the mistress to whom this woman seems devoted. Well,\n",
      "well, the point is a minor one, and when you have Randall you will\n",
      "probably find no difficulty in securing his accomplice. The lady's story\n",
      "certainly seems to be corroborated, if it needed corroboration, by every\n",
      "detail which we see before us.' He walked to the French window and threw\n",
      "it open. 'There are no signs here, but the ground is iron hard, and one\n",
      "would not expect them. I see that these candles in the mantelpiece have\n",
      "been lighted.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Yes, it was by their light, and that of the lady's bedroom candle, that\n",
      "the burglars saw their way about.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'And what did they take?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Well, they did not take much--only half a dozen articles of plate off\n",
      "the sideboard. Lady Brackenstall thinks that they were themselves so\n",
      "disturbed by the death of Sir Eustace that they did not ransack the\n",
      "house, as they would otherwise have done.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'No doubt that is true, and yet they drank some wine, I understand.'\n",
      "\n",
      "To steady their nerves.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Exactly. These three glasses upon the sideboard have been untouched, I\n",
      "suppose?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Yes, and the bottle stands as they left it.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Let us look at it. Halloa, halloa! What is this?'\n",
      "\n",
      "The three glasses were grouped together, all of them tinged with wine,\n",
      "and one of them containing some dregs of beeswing. The bottle stood near\n",
      "them, two-thirds full, and beside it lay a long, deeply stained cork.\n",
      "Its appearance and the dust upon the bottle showed that it was no common\n",
      "vintage which the murderers had enjoyed.\n",
      "\n",
      "A change had come over Holmes's manner. He had lost his listless\n",
      "expression, and again I saw an alert light of interest in his keen,\n",
      "deepset eyes. He raised the cork and examined it minutely.\n",
      "\n",
      "'How did they draw it?' he asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hopkins pointed to a half-opened drawer. In it lay some table linen and\n",
      "a large corkscrew.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Did Lady Brackenstall say that screw was used?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'No, you remember that she was senseless at the moment when the bottle\n",
      "was opened.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Quite so. As a matter of fact, that screw was _not_ used. This bottle\n",
      "was opened by a pocket screw, probably contained in a knife, and not\n",
      "more than an inch and a half long. If you will examine the top of the\n",
      "cork, you will observe that the screw was driven in three times before\n",
      "the cork was extracted. It has never been transfixed. This long screw\n",
      "would have transfixed it and drawn it up with a single pull. When you\n",
      "catch this fellow, you will find that he has one of these multiplex\n",
      "knives in his possession.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Excellent!' said Hopkins.\n",
      "\n",
      "'But these glasses do puzzle me, I confess. Lady Brackenstall actually\n",
      "_saw_ the three men drinking, did she not?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Yes; she was clear about that.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Then there is an end of it. What more is to be said? And yet, you must\n",
      "admit, that the three glasses are very remarkable, Hopkins. What? You\n",
      "see nothing remarkable? Well, well, let it pass. Perhaps, when a man has\n",
      "special knowledge and special powers like my own, it rather encourages\n",
      "him to seek a complex explanation when a simpler one is at hand. Of\n",
      "course, it must be a mere chance about the glasses. Well, good-morning,\n",
      "Hopkins. I don't see that I can be of any use to you, and you appear to\n",
      "have your case very clear. You will let me know when Randall is\n",
      "arrested, and any further developments which may occur. I trust that I\n",
      "shall soon have to congratulate you upon a successful conclusion. Come,\n",
      "Watson, I fancy that we may employ ourselves more profitably at home.'\n",
      "\n",
      "During our return journey, I could see by Holmes's face that he was much\n",
      "puzzled by something which he had observed. Every now and then, by an\n",
      "effort, he would throw off the impression, and talk as if the matter\n",
      "were clear, but then his doubts would settle down upon him again, and\n",
      "his knitted brows and abstracted eyes would show that his thoughts had\n",
      "gone back once more to the great dining-room of the Abbey Grange, in\n",
      "which this midnight tragedy had been enacted. At last, by a sudden\n",
      "impulse, just as our train was crawling out of a suburban station, he\n",
      "sprang on to the platform and pulled me out after him.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Excuse me, my dear fellow,' said he, as we watched the rear carriages\n",
      "of our train disappearing round a curve, 'I am sorry to make you the\n",
      "victim of what may seem a mere whim, but on my life, Watson, I simply\n",
      "_can't_ leave that case in this condition. Every instinct that I possess\n",
      "cries out against it. It's wrong--it's all wrong--I'll swear that it's\n",
      "wrong. And yet the lady's story was complete, the maid's corroboration\n",
      "was sufficient, the detail was fairly exact. What have I to put up\n",
      "against that? Three wineglasses, that is all. But if I had not taken\n",
      "things for granted, if I had examined everything with care which I\n",
      "should have shown had we approached the case _de novo_ and had no\n",
      "cut-and-dried story to warp my mind, should I not then have found\n",
      "something more definite to go upon? Of course I should. Sit down on this\n",
      "bench, Watson, until a train for Chislehurst arrives, and allow me to\n",
      "lay the evidence before you, imploring you in the first instance to\n",
      "dismiss from your mind the idea that anything which the maid or her\n",
      "mistress may have said must necessarily be true. The lady's charming\n",
      "personality must not be permitted to warp our judgment.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Surely there are details in her story which, if we looked at in cold\n",
      "blood, would excite our suspicion. These burglars made a considerable\n",
      "haul at Sydenham a fortnight ago. Some account of them and of their\n",
      "appearance was in the papers, and would naturally occur to anyone who\n",
      "wished to invent a story in which imaginary robbers should play a part.\n",
      "As a matter of fact, burglars who have done a good stroke of business\n",
      "are, as a rule, only too glad to enjoy the proceeds in peace and quiet\n",
      "without embarking on another perilous undertaking. Again, it is unusual\n",
      "for burglars to operate at so early an hour, it is unusual for burglars\n",
      "to strike a lady to prevent her screaming, since one would imagine that\n",
      "was the sure way to make her scream, it is unusual for them to commit\n",
      "murder when their numbers are sufficient to overpower one man, it is\n",
      "unusual for them to be content with a limited plunder when there was\n",
      "much more within their reach, and finally, I should say, that it was\n",
      "very unusual for such men to leave a bottle half empty. How do all these\n",
      "unusuals strike you, Watson?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Their cumulative effect is certainly considerable, and yet each of them\n",
      "is quite possible in itself. The most unusual thing of all, as it seems\n",
      "to me, is that the lady should be tied to the chair.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Well, I am not so clear about that, Watson, for it is evident that\n",
      "they must either kill her or else secure her in such a way that she\n",
      "could not give immediate notice of their escape. But at any rate I have\n",
      "shown, have I not, that there is a certain element of improbability\n",
      "about the lady's story? And now, on the top of this, comes the incident\n",
      "of the wineglasses.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'What about the wineglasses?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Can you see them in your mind's eye?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I see them clearly.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'We are told that three men drank from them. Does that strike you as\n",
      "likely?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Why not? There was wine in each glass.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Exactly, but there was beeswing only in one glass. You must have\n",
      "noticed that fact. What does that suggest to your mind?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'The last glass filled would be most likely to contain beeswing.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Not at all. The bottle was full of it, and it is inconceivable that the\n",
      "first two glasses were clear and the third heavily charged with it.\n",
      "There are two possible explanations, and only two. One is that after the\n",
      "second glass was filled the bottle was violently agitated, and so the\n",
      "third glass received the beeswing. That does not appear probable. No,\n",
      "no, I am sure that I am right.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'What, then, do you suppose?'\n",

      "only one of their line had reached a home port. It was the _Rock of\n",
      "Gibraltar_, their largest and best boat. A reference to the passenger\n",
      "list showed that Miss Fraser, of Adelaide, with her maid had made the\n",
      "voyage in her. The boat was now somewhere south of the Suez Canal on her\n",
      "way to Australia. Her officers were the same as in '95, with one\n",
      "exception. The first officer, Mr. Jack Crocker, had been made a captain\n",
      "and was to take charge of their new ship, the _Bass Rock_, sailing in\n",
      "two days' time from Southampton. He lived at Sydenham, but he was likely\n",

      "\n",
      "His record was magnificent. There was not an officer in the fleet to\n",
      "touch him. As to his character, he was reliable on duty, but a wild,\n",
      "desperate fellow off the deck of his ship--hot-headed, excitable, but\n",
      "loyal, honest, and kind-hearted. That was the pith of the information\n",
      "with which Holmes left the office of the Adelaide-Southampton company.\n",
      "Thence he drove to Scotland Yard, but, instead of entering, he sat in\n",
      "his cab with his brows drawn down, lost in profound thought. Finally he\n",
      "drove round to the Charing Cross telegraph office, sent off a message,\n",
      "and then, at last, we made for Baker Street once more.\n",

      "\n",
      "'Ah, a hiding-place--that is better!' cried Stanley Hopkins. 'Yes, yes,\n",
      "I see it all now! It was early, there were folk upon the roads, they\n",
      "were afraid of being seen with the silver, so they sank it in the pond,\n",

      "sit up reading in her own little room downstairs. I crept round there\n",
      "last night and scratched at the window. At first she would not open to\n",
      "me, but in her heart I know that now she loves me, and she could not\n",
      "leave me in the frosty night. She whispered to me to come round to the\n",
      "big front window, and I found it open before me, so as to let me into\n",
      "the dining-room. Again I heard from her own lips things that made my\n",
      "blood boil, and again I cursed this brute who mishandled the woman I\n",
      "loved. Well, gentlemen, I was standing with her just inside the window,\n",
      "in all innocence, as God is my judge, when he rushed like a madman into\n",
      "the room, called her the vilest name that a man could use to a woman,\n",
      "and welted her across the face with the stick he had in his hand. I had\n",
      "sprung for the poker, and it was a fair fight between us. See here, on\n",
      "my arm, where his first blow fell. Then it was my turn, and I went\n",
      "through him as if he had been a rotten pumpkin. Do you think I was\n",
      "sorry? Not I! It was his life or mine, but far more than that, it was\n",
      "his life or hers, for how could I leave her in the power of this madman?\n",
      "That was how I killed him. Was I wrong? well, then, what would either of\n",
      "you gentlemen have done, if you had been in my position?\n",
      "\n",
      "'She had screamed when he struck her, and that brought old Theresa down\n",
      "from the room above. There was a bottle of wine on the sideboard, and I\n",
      "opened it and poured a little between Mary's lips, for she was half dead\n",
      "with shock. Then I took a drop myself. Theresa was as cool as ice, and\n",
      "it was her plot as much as mine. We must make it appear that burglars\n",
      "had done the thing. Theresa kept on repeating our story to her mistress,\n",
      "while I swarmed up and cut the rope of the bell. Then I lashed her in\n",
      "her chair, and frayed out the end of the rope to make it look natural,\n",
      "else they would wonder how in the world a burglar could have got up\n",
      "there to cut it. Then I gathered up a few plates and pots of silver, to\n",
      "carry out the idea of the robbery, and there I left them, with orders to\n",
      "give the alarm when I had a quarter of an hour's start. I dropped the\n",
      "silver into the pond, and made off for Sydenham, feeling that for once\n",
      "in my life I had done a real good night's work. And that's the truth and\n",

      "but a sailor could have made the knots with which the cord was fastened\n",
      "to the chair. Only once had this lady been brought into contact with\n",
      "sailors, and that was on her voyage, and it was someone of her own class\n",
      "of life, since she was trying hard to shield him, and so showing that\n",

      "The ordinary West-End Londoner--who is a citizen of no city at all, but\n",
      "dwells amid a mere conglomerate of houses at a certain distance from\n",
      "Charing Cross--has known a fleeting surprise when, by rare chance, his\n",
      "eye fell upon the name of some such newspaper as the _Battersea Times_,\n",
      "the _Camberwell Mercury_, or the _Islington Gazette_. To him, these and\n",
      "the like districts are nothing more than compass points of the huge\n",
      "metropolis. He may be in practice acquainted with them; if historically\n",
      "inclined, he may think of them as old-time villages swallowed up by\n",
      "insatiable London; but he has never grasped the fact that in Battersea,\n",
      "Camberwell, Islington, there are people living who name these places as\n",
      "their home; who are born, subsist, and die there as though in a distinct\n",
      "town, and practically without consciousness of its obliteration in the\n",
      "map of a world capital.\n",
      "\n",
      "The stable element of this population consists of more or less\n",
      "old-fashioned people. Round about them is the ceaseless coming and going\n",
      "of nomads who keep abreast with the time, who take their lodgings by the\n",
      "week, their houses by the month; who camp indifferently in regions old\n",
      "and new, learning their geography in train and tram-car. Abiding\n",
      "parishioners are wont to be either very poor or established in a\n",
      "moderate prosperity; they lack enterprise, either for good or ill: if\n",
      "comfortably off, they owe it, as a rule, to some predecessor's exertion.\n",
      "And for the most part, though little enough endowed with the civic\n",
      "spirit, they abundantly pride themselves on their local permanence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Representative of this class was Mr. Archibald Jordan, a native of\n",
      "Islington, and, at the age of five-and-forty, still faithful to the\n",
      "streets which he had trodden as a child. His father started a small\n",
      "grocery business in Upper Street; Archibald succeeded to the shop,\n",
      "advanced soberly, and at length admitted a partner, by whose capital and\n",
      "energy the business was much increased. After his thirtieth year Mr.\n",
      "Jordan ceased to stand behind the counter. Of no very active\n",
      "disposition, and but moderately set on gain, he found it pleasant to\n",
      "spend a few hours daily over the books and the correspondence, and for\n",
      "the rest of his time to enjoy a gossipy leisure, straying among the\n",
      "acquaintances of a lifetime, or making new in the decorous bar-parlours,\n",
      "billiard-rooms, and other such retreats which allured his bachelor\n",
      "liberty. His dress and bearing were unpretentious, but impressively\n",
      "respectable; he never allowed his garments (made by an Islington tailor,\n",
      "an old schoolfellow) to exhibit the least sign of wear, but fashion\n",
      "affected their style as little as possible. Of middle height, and\n",
      "tending to portliness, he walked at an unvarying pace, as a man who had\n",
      "never known undignified hurry; in his familiar thoroughfares he glanced\n",
      "about him with a good-humoured air of proprietorship, or with a look of\n",
      "thoughtful criticism for any changes that might be going forward. No one\n",
      "had ever spoken flatteringly of his visage; he knew himself a very\n",
      "homely-featured man, and accepted the fact, as something that had\n",
      "neither favoured nor hindered him in life. But it was his conviction\n",
      "that no man's eye had a greater power of solemn and overwhelming rebuke,\n",
      "and this gift he took a pleasure in exercising, however trivial the\n",
      "occasion.\n",
      "\n",
      "For five-and-twenty years he had lived in lodgings; always within the\n",
      "narrow range of Islington respectability, yet never for more than a\n",
      "twelvemonth under the same roof. This peculiar feature of Mr. Jordan's\n",
      "life had made him a subject of continual interest to local landladies,\n",
      "among whom were several lifelong residents, on friendly terms of old\n",
      "time with the Jordan family. To them it seemed an astonishing thing that\n",
      "a man in such circumstances had not yet married; granting this\n",
      "eccentricity, they could not imagine what made him change his abode so\n",
      "often. Not a landlady in Islington but would welcome Mr. Jordan in her\n",
      "rooms, and, having got him, do her utmost to prolong the connection. He\n",
      "had been known to quit a house on the paltriest excuse, removing to\n",
      "another in which he could not expect equally good treatment. There was\n",
      "no accounting for it: it must be taken as an ultimate mystery of life,\n",
      "and made the most of as a perennial topic of neighbourly conversation.\n",
      "\n",
      "As to the desirability of having Mr. Jordan for a lodger there could be\n",
      "no difference of opinion among rational womankind. Mrs. Wiggins, indeed,\n",
      "had taken his sudden departure from her house so ill that she always\n",
      "spoke of him abusively; but who heeded Mrs. Wiggins? Even in the sadness\n",
      "of hope deferred, those ladies who had entertained him once, and\n",
      "speculated on his possible return, declared Mr. Jordan a 'thorough\n",
      "gentleman'. Lodgers, as a class, do not recommend themselves in\n",
      "Islington; Mr. Jordan shone against the dusky background with almost\n",
      "dazzling splendour. To speak of lodgers as of cattle, he was a prize\n",
      "creature. A certain degree of comfort he firmly exacted; he might be a\n",
      "trifle fastidious about cooking; he stood upon his dignity; but no one\n",
      "could say that he grudged reward for service rendered. It was his\n",
      "practice to pay more than the landlady asked. Twenty-five shillings a\n",
      "week, you say? I shall give you twenty-eight. _But_--' and with raised\n",
      "forefinger he went through the catalogue of his demands. Everything must\n",
      "be done precisely as he directed; even in the laying of his table he\n",
      "insisted upon certain minute peculiarities, and to forget one of them\n",
      "was to earn that gaze of awful reprimand which Mr. Jordan found (or\n",
      "thought) more efficacious than any spoken word. Against this precision\n",
      "might be set his strange indulgence in the matter of bills; he merely\n",
      "regarded the total, was never known to dispute an item. Only twice in\n",
      "his long experience had he quitted a lodging because of exorbitant\n",
      "charges, and on these occasions he sternly refused to discuss the\n",
      "matter. 'Mrs. Hawker, I am paying your account with the addition of one\n",
      "week's rent. Your rooms will be vacant at eleven o'clock tomorrow\n",
      "morning.' And until the hour of departure no entreaty, no prostration,\n",
      "could induce him to utter a syllable.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was on the 1st of June, 1889, his forty-fifth birthday, that Mr.\n",
      "Jordan removed from quarters he had occupied for ten months, and became\n",
      "a lodger in the house of Mrs. Elderfield.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Elderfield, a widow, aged three-and-thirty, with one little girl,\n",
      "was but a casual resident in Islington; she knew nothing of Mr. Jordan,\n",
      "and made no inquiries about him. Strongly impressed, as every woman must\n",
      "needs be, by his air and tone of mild authority, she congratulated\n",
      "herself on the arrival of such an inmate; but no subservience appeared\n",
      "in her demeanour; she behaved with studious civility, nothing more. Her\n",
      "words were few and well chosen. Always neatly dressed, yet always busy,\n",
      "she moved about the house with quick, silent step, and cleanliness\n",
      "marked her path. The meals were well cooked, well served. Mr. Jordan\n",
      "being her only lodger, she could devote to him an undivided attention.\n",
      "At the end of his first week the critical gentleman felt greater\n",
      "satisfaction than he had ever known.\n",
      "\n",
      "The bill lay upon his table at breakfast-time. He perused the items,\n",
      "and, much against his habit, reflected upon them. Having breakfasted, he\n",
      "rang the bell.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Mrs. Elderfield--'\n",
      "\n",
      "He paused, and looked gravely at the widow. She had a plain, honest,\n",
      "healthy face, with resolute lips, and an eye that brightened when she\n",
      "spoke; her well-knit figure, motionless in its respectful attitude,\n",
      "declared a thoroughly sound condition of the nerves.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Mrs. Elderfield, your bill is so very moderate that I think you must\n",
      "have forgotten something.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Have you looked it over, sir?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I never trouble with the details. Please examine it.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'There is no need, sir. I never make a mistake.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I said, Mrs. Elderfield, please _examine_ it.'\n",
      "\n",
      "She seemed to hesitate, but obeyed.\n",
      "\n",
      "'The bill is quite correct, sir.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Thank you.'\n",
      "\n",
      "He paid it at once and said no more.\n",
      "\n",
      "The weeks went on. To Mr. Jordan's surprise, his landlady's zeal and\n",
      "efficiency showed no diminution, a thing unprecedented in his long and\n",
      "varied experience. After the first day or two he had found nothing to\n",
      "correct; every smallest instruction was faithfully carried out.\n",
      "Moreover, he knew for the first time in his life the comfort of\n",
      "absolutely clean rooms. The best of his landladies hitherto had not\n",
      "risen above that conception of cleanliness which is relative to London\n",
      "soot and fog. His palate, too, was receiving an education. Probably he\n",
      "had never eaten of a joint rightly cooked, or tasted a potato boiled as\n",
      "it should be; more often than not, the food set before him had undergone\n",
      "a process which left it masticable indeed, but void of savour and\n",
      "nourishment. Many little attentions of which he had never dreamed kept\n",
      "him in a wondering cheerfulness. And at length he said to himself: 'Here\n",
      "I shall stay.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Not that his constant removals had been solely due to discomfort and a\n",
      "hope of better things. The secret--perhaps not entirely revealed even to\n",
      "himself--lay in Mr. Jordan's sense of his own importance, and his\n",
      "uneasiness whenever he felt that, in the eyes of a landlady, he was\n",
      "becoming a mere everyday person--an ordinary lodger. No sooner did he\n",
      "detect a sign of this than he made up his mind to move. It gave him the\n",
      "keenest pleasure of which he was capable when, on abruptly announcing\n",
      "his immediate departure, he perceived the landlady's profound\n",
      "mortification. To make the blow heavier he had even resorted to\n",
      "artifice, seeming to express a most lively contentment during the very\n",
      "days when he had decided to leave and was asking himself where he should\n",
      "next abide. One of his delights was to return to a house which he had\n",
      "quitted years ago, to behold the excitement and bustle occasioned by his\n",
      "appearance, and play the good-natured autocrat over grovelling\n",
      "dependents. In every case, save the two already mentioned, he had parted\n",
      "with his landlady on terms of friendliness, never vouchsafing a reason\n",
      "for his going away, genially eluding every attempt to obtain an\n",
      "explanation, and at the last abounding in graceful recognition of all\n",
      "that had been done for him. Mr. Jordan shrank from dispute, hated every\n",
      "sort of contention; this characteristic gave a certain refinement to his\n",
      "otherwise commonplace existence. Vulgar vanity would have displayed\n",
      "itself in precisely the acts and words from which his self-esteem\n",
      "nervously shrank. And of late he had been thinking over the list of\n",
      "landladies, with a half-formed desire to settle down, to make himself a\n",
      "permanent home. Doubtless as a result of this state of mind, he betook\n",
      "himself to a strange house, where, as from neutral ground, he might\n",
      "reflect upon the lodgings he knew, and judge between their merits. He\n",
      "could not foresee what awaited him under Mrs. Elderfield's roof; the\n",
      "event impressed him as providential; he felt, with singular emotion,\n",
      "that choice was taken out of his hands. Lodgings could not be more than\n",
      "perfect, and such he had found.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was not his habit to chat with landladies. At times he held forth to\n",
      "them on some topic of interest, suavely, instructively; if he gave in to\n",
      "their ordinary talk, it was with a half-absent smile of condescension.\n",
      "Mrs. Elderfield seeming as little disposed to gossip as himself, a month\n",
      "elapsed before he knew anything of her history; but one evening the\n",
      "reserve on both sides was broken. His landlady modestly inquired whether\n",
      "she was giving satisfaction, and Mr. Jordan replied with altogether\n",
      "unwonted fervour. In the dialogue that ensued, they exchanged personal\n",
      "confidences. The widow had lost her husband four years ago; she came\n",
      "from the Midlands, but had long dwelt in London. Then fell from her lips\n",
      "a casual remark which made the hearer uneasy.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I don't think I shall always stay here. The neighbourhood is too\n",
      "crowded. I should like to have a house somewhere further out.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Jordan did not comment on this, but it kept a place in his daily\n",
      "thoughts, and became at length so much of an anxiety that he invited\n",
      "a renewal of the subject.\n",
      "\n",
      "'You have no intention of moving just yet, Mrs. Elderfield?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I was going to tell you, sir,' replied the landlady, with her\n",
      "respectful calm, 'that I have decided to make a change next spring. Some\n",
      "friends of mine have gone to live at Wood Green, and I shall look for a\n",
      "house in the same neighbourhood.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Jordan was, in private, gravely disturbed. He who had flitted from\n",
      "house to house for many years, distressing the souls of landladies, now\n",
      "lamented the prospect of a forced removal. It was open to him to\n",
      "accompany Mrs. Elderfield, but he shrank from the thought of living in\n",
      "so remote a district. Wood Green! The very name appalled him, for he had\n",
      "never been able to endure the country. He betook himself one dreary\n",
      "autumn afternoon to that northern suburb, and what he saw did not at all\n",
      "reassure him. On his way back he began once more to review the list of\n",
      "old lodgings.\n",
      "\n",
      "But from that day his conversations with Mrs. Elderfield grew more\n",
      "frequent, more intimate. In the evening he occasionally made an excuse\n",
      "for knocking at her parlour door, and lingered for a talk which ended\n",
      "only at supper time. He spoke of his own affairs, and grew more ready to\n",
      "do so as his hearer manifested a genuine interest, without impertinent\n",
      "curiosity. Little by little he imparted to Mrs. Elderfield a complete\n",
      "knowledge of his commercial history, of his pecuniary standing--matters\n",
      "of which he had never before spoken to a mere acquaintance. A change was\n",
      "coming over him; the foundations of habit crumbled beneath his feet; he\n",
      "lost his look of complacence, his self-confident and superior tone.\n",
      "Bar-parlours and billiard-rooms saw him but rarely and flittingly. He\n",
      "seemed to have lost his pleasure in the streets of Islington, and spent\n",
      "all his spare time by the fireside, perpetually musing.\n",
      "\n",
      "On a day in March one of his old landladies, Mrs. Higdon, sped to the\n",
      "house of another, Mrs. Evans, panting under a burden of strange news.\n",
      "Could it be believed! Mr. Jordan was going to marry--to marry that woman\n",
      "in whose house he was living! Mrs. Higdon had it on the very best\n",
      "authority--that of Mr. Jordan's partner, who spoke of the affair without\n",
      "reserve. A new house had already been taken--at Wood Green. Well! After\n",
      "all these years, after so many excellent opportunities, to marry a mere\n",
      "stranger and forsake Islington! In a moment Mr. Jordan's character was\n",
      "gone; had he figured in the police-court under some disgraceful charge,\n",
      "these landladies could hardly have felt more shocked and professed\n",
      "themselves more disgusted. The intelligence spread. Women went out of\n",
      "their way to have a sight of Mrs. Elderfield's house; they hung about\n",
      "for a glimpse of that sinister person herself. She had robbed them,\n",
      "every one, of a possible share in Islington's prize lodger. Had it been\n",
      "one of themselves they could have borne the chagrin; but a woman whom\n",
      "not one of them knew, an alien! What base arts had she practised? Ah,\n",
      "it was better not to inquire too closely into the secrets of that\n",
      "lodging-house.\n",
      "\n",
      "Though every effort was made to learn the time and place of the\n",
      "ceremony, Mr. Jordan's landladies had the mortification to hear of his\n",
      "wedding only when it was over. Of course, this showed that he felt the\n",
      "disgracefulness of his behaviour; he was not utterly lost to shame. It\n",
      "could only be hoped that he would not know the bitterness of repentance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not till he found himself actually living in the house at Wood Green did\n",
      "Mr. Jordan realize how little his own will had had to do with the recent\n",
      "course of events. Certainly, he had made love to the widow, and had\n",
      "asked her to marry him; but from that point onward he seemed to have put\n",
      "himself entirely in Mrs. Elderfield's hands, granting every request,\n",
      "meeting half-way every suggestion she offered, becoming, in short, quite\n",
      "a different kind of man from his former self. He had not been sensible\n",
      "of a moment's reluctance; he enjoyed the novel sense of yielding himself\n",
      "to affectionate guidance. His wits had gone wool-gathering; they\n",
      "returned to him only after the short honeymoon at Brighton, when he\n",
      "stood upon his own hearth-rug, and looked round at the new furniture\n",
      "and ornaments which symbolized a new beginning of life.\n",
      "\n",
      "The admirable landlady had shown herself energetic, clear-headed, and\n",
      "full of resource; it was she who chose the house, and transacted all the\n",
      "business in connection with it; Mr. Jordan had merely run about in her\n",
      "company from place to place, smiling approval and signing cheques. No\n",
      "one could have gone to work more prudently, or obtained what she wanted\n",
      "at smaller outlay; for all that, Mr. Jordan, having recovered something\n",
      "like his normal frame of mind, viewed the results with consternation.\n",
      "Left to himself, he would have taken a very small house, and furnished\n",
      "it much in the style of Islington lodgings; as it was, he occupied a\n",
      "ten-roomed 'villa', with appointments which seemed to him luxurious,\n",
      "aristocratic. True, the expenditure was of no moment to a man in his\n",
      "position, and there was no fear that Mrs. Jordan would involve him in\n",
      "dangerous extravagance; but he had always lived with such excessive\n",
      "economy that the sudden change to a life correspondent with his income\n",
      "could not but make him uncomfortable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Jordan had, of course, seen to it that her personal appearance\n",
      "harmonized with the new surroundings. She dressed herself and her young\n",
      "daughter with careful appropriateness. There was no display, no purchase\n",
      "of gewgaws--merely garments of good quality, such as became people in\n",
      "easy circumstances. She impressed upon her husband that this was nothing\n",
      "more than a return to the habits of her earlier life. Her first marriage\n",
      "had been a sad mistake; it had brought her down in the world. Now she\n",
      "felt restored to her natural position.\n",
      "\n",
      "After a week of restlessness, Mr. Jordan resumed his daily visits to\n",
      "the shop in Upper Street, where he sat as usual among the books and the\n",
      "correspondence, and tried to assure himself that all would henceforth\n",
      "be well with him. No more changing from house to house; a really\n",
      "comfortable home in which to spend the rest of his days; a kind and most\n",
      "capable wife to look after all his needs, to humour all his little\n",
      "habits. He could not have taken a wiser step.\n",
      "\n",
      "For all that, he had lost something, though he did not yet understand\n",
      "what it was. The first perception of a change not for the better flashed\n",
      "upon him one evening in the second week, when he came home an hour\n",
      "later than his wont. Mrs. Jordan, who always stood waiting for him at\n",
      "the window, had no smile as he entered.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Why are you late?' she asked, in her clear, restrained voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Oh--something or other kept me.'\n",
      "\n",
      "This would not do. Mrs. Jordan quietly insisted on a full explanation of\n",
      "the delay, and it seemed to her unsatisfactory.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I hope you won't be irregular in your habits, Archibald,' said his\n",
      "wife, with gentle admonition. 'What I always liked in you was your\n",
      "methodical way of living. I shall be very uncomfortable if I never\n",
      "know when to expect you.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Yes, my dear, but--business, you see--'\n",
      "\n",
      "'But you have explained that you _could_ have been back at the usual\n",
      "time.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Yes--that's true--but--'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Well, well, you won't let it happen again. Oh really, Archibald!' she\n",
      "suddenly exclaimed. 'The idea of you coming into the room with muddy\n",
      "boots! Why, look! There's a patch of mud on the carpet--'\n",
      "\n",
      "'It was my hurry to speak to you,' murmured Mr. Jordan, in confusion.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Please go at once and take your boots off. And you left your slippers\n",
      "in the bedroom this morning. You must always bring them down, and put\n",
      "them in the dining-room cupboard; then they're ready for you when you\n",
      "come into the house.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Jordan had but a moderate appetite for his dinner, and he did not\n",
      "talk so pleasantly as usual. This was but the beginning of troubles such\n",
      "as he had not for a moment foreseen. His wife, having since their\n",
      "engagement taken the upper hand, began to show her determination to keep\n",
      "it, and day by day her rule grew more galling to the ex-bachelor. He\n",
      "himself, in the old days, had plagued his landladies by insisting upon\n",
      "method and routine, by his faddish attention to domestic minutiae; he\n",
      "now learnt what it was to be subjected to the same kind of despotism,\n",
      "exercised with much more exasperating persistence. Whereas Mrs.\n",
      "Elderfield had scrupulously obeyed every direction given by her lodger,\n",
      "Mrs. Jordan was evidently resolved that her husband should live, move,\n",
      "and have his being in the strictest accordance with her own ideal. Not\n",
      "in any spirit of nagging, or ill-tempered unreasonableness; it was\n",
      "merely that she had her favourite way of doing every conceivable thing,\n",
      "and felt so sure it was the best of all possible ways that she could not\n",
      "endure any other. The first serious disagreement between them had\n",
      "reference to conduct at the breakfast-table. After a broken night,\n",
      "feeling headachy and worried, Mr. Jordan took up his newspaper, folded\n",
      "it conveniently, and set it against the bread so that he could read\n",
      "while eating. Without a word, his wife gently removed it, and laid it\n",
      "aside on a chair.\n",
      "\n",
      "'What are you doing?' he asked gruffly.\n",
      "\n",
      "'You mustn't read at meals, Archibald. It's bad manners, and bad for your\n",
      "digestion.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I've read the news at breakfast all my life, and I shall do so still,'\n",
      "exclaimed the husband, starting up and recovering his paper.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Then you will have breakfast by yourself. Nelly, we must go into the\n",
      "other room till papa has finished.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Jordan ate mechanically, and stared at the newspaper with just as\n",
      "little consciousness. Prompted by the underlying weakness of his\n",
      "character to yield for the sake of peace, wrath made him dogged, and the\n",
      "more steadily he regarded his position, the more was he appalled by the\n",
      "outlook. Why, this meant downright slavery! He had married a woman so\n",
      "horribly like himself in several points that his only hope lay in\n",
      "overcoming her by sheer violence. A thoroughly good and well-meaning\n",
      "woman, an excellent housekeeper, the kind of wife to do him credit and\n",
      "improve his social position; but self-willed, pertinacious, and probably\n",
      "thinking herself his superior in every respect. He had nothing to fear\n",
      "but subjection--the one thing he had never anticipated, the one thing he\n",
      "could never endure.\n",
      "\n",
      "He went off to business without seeing his wife again, and passed a\n",
      "lamentable day. At his ordinary hour of return, instead of setting off\n",
      "homeward, he strayed about the by-streets of Islington and Pentonville.\n",
      "Not till this moment had he felt how dear they were to him, the familiar\n",
      "streets; their very odours fell sweet upon his nostrils. Never again\n",
      "could he go hither and thither, among the old friends, the old places,\n",
      "to his heart's content. What had possessed him to abandon this precious\n",
      "liberty! The thought of Wood Green revolted him; live there as long as\n",
      "he might, he would never be at home. He thought of his wife (now waiting\n",
      "for him) with fear, and then with a reaction of rage. Let her wait!\n",
      "He--Archibald Jordan--before whom women had bowed and trembled for\n",
      "five-and-twenty years--was _he_ to come and go at a wife's bidding? And\n",
      "at length the thought seemed so utterly preposterous that he sped\n",
      "northward as fast as possible, determined to right himself this very\n",
      "evening.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Jordan sat alone. He marched into the room with muddy boots, flung\n",
      "his hat and overcoat into a chair, and poked the fire violently. His\n",
      "wife's eye was fixed on him, and she first spoke--in the quiet voice\n",
      "that he dreaded.\n",
      "\n",
      "'What do you mean by carrying on like this, Archibald?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I shall carry on as I like in my own house--hear that?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I do hear it, and I'm very sorry too. It gives me a very bad opinion\n",
      "of you. You will _not_ do as you like in your own house. Rage as you\n",
      "please. You will _not_ do as you like in your own house.'\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a contemptuous anger in her eye which the man could not face.\n",
      "He lost all control of himself, uttered coarse oaths, and stood\n",
      "quivering. Then the woman began to lecture him; she talked steadily,\n",
      "acrimoniously, for more than an hour, regardless of his interruptions.\n",
      "Nervously exhausted, he fled at length from the room. A couple of hours\n",
      "later they met again in the nuptial chamber, and again Mrs. Jordan began\n",
      "to talk. Her point, as before, was that he had begun married life about\n",
      "as badly as possible. Why had he married her at all? What fault had she\n",
      "committed to incur such outrageous usage? But, thank goodness, she had a\n",
      "will of her own, and a proper self-respect; behave as he might, _she_\n",
      "would still persevere in the path of womanly duty. If he thought to make\n",
      "her life unbearable he would find his mistake; she simply should not\n",
      "heed him; perhaps he would return to his senses before long--and in this\n",
      "vein Mrs. Jordan continued until night was at odds with morning, only\n",
      "becoming silent when her partner had sunk into the oblivion of uttermost\n",
      "fatigue.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next day Mr. Jordan's demeanour showed him, for the moment at all\n",
      "events, defeated. He made no attempt to read at breakfast; he moved\n",
      "about very quietly. And in the afternoon he came home at the regulation\n",
      "hour.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Jordan had friends in the neighbourhood, but she saw little of\n",
      "them. She was not a woman of ordinary tastes. Everything proved that,\n",
      "to her mind, the possession of a nice house, with the prospects of a\n",
      "comfortable life, was an end in itself; she had no desire to exhibit her\n",
      "well-furnished rooms, or to gad about talking of her advantages. Every\n",
      "moment of her day was taken up in the superintendence of servants, the\n",
      "discharge of an infinitude of housewifely tasks. She had no assistance\n",
      "from her daughter; the girl went to school, and was encouraged to study\n",
      "with the utmost application. The husband's presence in the house seemed\n",
      "a mere accident--save in the still nocturnal season, when Mrs. Jordan\n",
      "bestowed upon him her counsel and her admonitions.\n",
      "\n",
      "After the lapse of a few days Mr. Jordan again offered combat, and threw\n",
      "himself into it with a frenzy.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Look here!' he shouted at length, 'either you or I are going to leave\n",
      "this house. I can't live with you--understand? I hate the sight of you!'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Go on!' retorted the other, with mild bitterness. 'Abuse me as much as\n",
      "you like, I can bear it. I shall continue to do my duty, and unless you\n",
      "have recourse to personal violence, here I remain. If you go too far, of\n",
      "course the law must defend me!'\n",
      "\n",
      "This was precisely what Mr. Jordan knew and dreaded; the law was on his\n",
      "wife's side, and by applying at a police-court for protection she could\n",
      "overwhelm him with shame and ridicule, which would make life\n",
      "intolerable. Impossible to argue with this woman. Say what he might, the\n",
      "fault always seemed his. His wife was simply doing her duty--in a spirit\n",
      "of admirable thoroughness; he, in the eyes of a third person, would\n",
      "appear an unreasonable and violent curmudgeon. Had it not all sprung out\n",
      "of his obstinacy with regard to reading at breakfast? How explain to\n",
      "anyone what he suffered in his nerves, in his pride, in the outraged\n",
      "habitudes of a lifetime?\n",
      "\n",
      "That evening he did not return to Wood Green. Afraid of questions\n",
      "if he showed himself in the old resorts, he spent some hours in a\n",
      "billiard-room near King's Cross, and towards midnight took a bedroom\n",
      "under the same roof. On going to business next day, he awaited with\n",
      "tremors either a telegram or a visit from his wife; but the whole day\n",
      "passed, and he heard nothing. After dark he walked once more about the\n",
      "beloved streets, pausing now and then to look up at the windows of this\n",
      "or that well remembered house. Ah, if he durst but enter and engage a\n",
      "lodging! Impossible--for ever impossible!\n",
      "\n",
      "He slept in the same place as on the night before. And again a day\n",
      "passed without any sort of inquiry from Wood Green. When evening came\n",
      "he went home.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Jordan behaved as though he had returned from business in the usual\n",
      "way. 'Is it raining?' she asked, with a half-smile. And her husband\n",
      "replied, in as matter-of-fact a tone as he could command, 'No, it\n",
      "isn't.' There was no mention between them of his absence. That night,\n",
      "Mrs. Jordan talked for an hour or two of his bad habit of stepping on\n",
      "the paint when he went up and down stairs, then fell calmly asleep.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Mr. Jordan did not sleep for a long time. What! was he, after all,\n",
      "to be allowed his liberty _out_ of doors, provided he relinquished it\n",
      "within? Was it really the case that his wife, satisfied with her house\n",
      "and furniture and income, did not care a jot whether he stayed away or\n",
      "came home? There, indeed, gleamed a hope. When Mr. Jordan slept, he\n",
      "dreamed that he was back again in lodgings at Islington, tasting an\n",
      "extraordinary bliss. Day dissipated the vision, but still Mrs. Jordan\n",
      "spoke not a word of his absence, and with trembling still he hoped.\n",
